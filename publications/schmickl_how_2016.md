*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system is a computational model called Primordial Particle System (PPS), simulating a population of identical, self-propelled particles (SPPs) moving asynchronously in a continuous 2D toroidal space. Particles interact locally based on a simple motion law (Equation 1) where their change in heading (Δφ) depends on a fixed rotation (α), a density-dependent rotation (β * N), and the relative number of neighbors on their left (L) vs. right (R) within a radius (r): ΔΦ/Δt = α + β * N * sign(R - L). Particles move at a constant velocity (v). The purpose is to demonstrate and analyze the spontaneous emergence of self-structuring, self-reproducing, and self-sustaining "life-like" patterns (protocells, spores) and their ecosystem dynamics from simple, local rules without global information or complex programming. Components are the particles, the space, and the motion rule with its parameters (r, α, β, v).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`="Computational Model", `domain`="Artificial Life/Complexity", `mechanism`="Self-Propelled Particles with Local Interaction Rule", `components`=["Particles", "Toroidal Space", "Motion Law (Eq.1)"], `purpose`="Emergence of life-like structures and dynamics from simple rules". `ComponentNode` (Particle) attributes: `position`, `heading`, `velocity`. `InteractionEdge` (Particle-Particle) attributes: `rule`="Eq.1", `radius`='r', `parameters`=['α', 'β'].
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the system as a population of particles (PPS), defines their state variables (position, heading), motion (constant velocity v), interaction radius (r), the toroidal space, asynchronous updates, and the core motion law (Equation 1 with parameters α, β, L, R, N). The purpose of studying emergent life-like structures is stated clearly in the abstract and introduction.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The core motion law (Eq. 1), particle updates (position calculation), simulation space (continuous, toroidal), neighbor definition (semicircles left/right within radius r), and default parameters are clearly stated. Pseudo-code (Fig 1) and detailed descriptions of simulation setups for specific figures (particle numbers, densities, time steps, initial conditions) are provided. The asynchronous update mechanism is mentioned. Minor ambiguities might exist regarding the exact implementation details of neighbor counting in continuous space at boundary conditions, but overall clarity is high.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The score is based on the explicit descriptions, equations, pseudocode, and parameter values provided throughout the Methods section.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Interaction Radius (r) | 5 | space units | Methods (Default PPS parameters) | Explicit | High | N/A |

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The system assumes a constant energy influx that allows particles to maintain a fixed velocity 'v'. This represents an open system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, implicitly powered to sustain motion. The source is not physically specified but is a modeling assumption.
    *   Value: N/A (Modeled as constant velocity `v=0.67` space units/time step)
    *   Units: N/A (Implicitly energy per particle per time step sufficient to maintain `v`)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`="Implicit/Modeled Influx", `type`="Constant kinetic energy maintenance". Linked to `ComponentNode` (Particle).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly states "assuming an open system allowing steady energy influx for motion" and constant velocity 'v'. The quantification or specific nature of the energy source is implicit in the model design (constant v).

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: The assumed energy input is transduced into the kinetic energy of the particles, maintaining their constant speed 'v'. Energy is used to change particle heading based on local interactions (Eq. 1) and then translates into positional changes (motion). There are no other energy forms or transformations explicitly modeled.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`="Input to Kinetic", `from_node`=`EnergyInputNode`, `to_node`=`ComponentNode` (Particle - kinetic energy state). `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`="Kinetic to Configurational Change", `from_node`=`ComponentNode` (Particle), `to_node`=`SystemNode` (representing spatial configuration).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The transduction from an abstract influx to kinetic energy is implied by the model's constant velocity rule. The use of this kinetic energy to enact positional changes based on interaction calculations is also implicit in the model's update steps.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: Energy efficiency is not discussed or quantified in the paper. The model assumes perfect transduction of implicit energy input into motion at constant velocity 'v', without considering physical limitations or losses in the "actuation" (change of heading and movement). Therefore, assigning a meaningful efficiency score is not possible.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
      *  Justification: No information regarding energy efficiency is provided.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Dissipation is not explicitly modeled (e.g., via friction). However, the system is described as a dissipative system in the discussion ("in the long-timescale view our system can be understood as a physical dissipative system"). The emergence of stable structures and steady states (like the logistic growth equilibrium) implies a balance between the assumed energy input (driving motion and organization) and some form of implicit dissipation or effective "cooling" that prevents unbounded energy increase or chaotic divergence everywhere. This dissipation is inherent in the system reaching stable or statistically stationary states rather than exploding. Quantification is not provided. Assessment: Medium (implicit, required for stability).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyDissipationNode`: attributes - `type`="Implicit/Effective". `EnergyDissipationEdge`: `from_node`=`SystemNode` (representing overall system state/dynamics), `to_node`=`EnergyDissipationNode`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The term "dissipative system" is used in the discussion, but the mechanism is not explicitly modeled or quantified. Its presence is inferred from the system's ability to self-organize into stable structures and reach equilibrium states, which requires energy loss or stabilization.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system state (positions and orientations of all particles) at time 't' determines the state at 't+1'. More significantly, the formation and persistence of structures (spores, cells) represent a form of embodied, structural memory. These structures are stable configurations resulting from the history of particle interactions, and their presence influences future system evolution (e.g., replication, interaction with other structures/particles). The system "remembers" its organized state.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The paper doesn't explicitly label particle positions or structures as "memory" in a computational sense. However, the persistence of structures and their influence on future dynamics is a clear demonstration of state persistence influencing future behavior, fitting the definition of memory provided in the template.

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 3
*   Justification: The memory is embodied in the spatial configuration of particles (structural memory). It's not explicitly addressable or easily re-writable like digital memory. Structures (spores, cells) represent persistent states (attractors) arising from the system dynamics. Retention is linked to structure stability/lifetime. Capacity relates to the number and complexity of possible stable structures. Read-out is implicit via interactions. It's closer to physical phenomena like hysteresis or phase state than computational memory. The low score reflects the lack of distinct, addressable states, low capacity for encoding arbitrary information, and non-programmable nature.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: `MemoryNode`: attributes - `type`="Structural/Embodied", `mechanism`="Stable Particle Configurations (Attractors)". Related to `ConfigurationalNode` from M4.3.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    * Justification: The type of memory (structural/embodied) is inferred from the system's description and behavior (persistent structures). The score is an interpretation based on comparing this to typical memory characteristics.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: Variable (e.g., ~2,000 to >25,000+ time steps for cells, potentially longer for spores)
*    Units: time steps (Qualitative Descriptor: Short-term to Long-term, depending on structure and environment)
*   Justification: Memory retention corresponds to the lifetime/persistence of the emergent structures (cells, spores). Figure 6C shows cell lifetimes depend heavily on environmental particle density (DPE), ranging from medians of ~2,300 steps (low DPE) to >25,000+ steps (high DPE, run limit). Spores are suggested to be more stable ("stable spores" mentioned in discussion). Lifetimes up to 1,000,000 steps are shown for the ecosystem (Fig 3H).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: Structure lifetimes are explicitly measured and reported (e.g., Fig 6C, Fig 3H run duration). Interpreting this lifetime as "memory retention time" is implicit based on M3.1/M3.2.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `retention_time` of `MemoryNode` (representing a structure like a cell or spore). Value is context-dependent (DPE).

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: Low (Qualitative)
*   Units: N/A (Potentially number of distinct stable structure types/sizes)
*   Justification: The system exhibits a limited repertoire of stable structures described (nutrients, premature spores, mature spores, ring cells, triangle cells). While variations in size exist, the fundamental "types" of memory states seem few. Capacity is not formally quantified in terms of bits or distinct addressable states.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Inferred from the limited number of distinct structure types described and visualized in the paper (Figs 2, 4). No explicit quantification of capacity provided.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `capacity` of `MemoryNode`(representing the system's state space).

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: Memory "readout" happens implicitly through particle interactions. The state (structure) influences how particles interact (via Eq. 1), but there's no concept of reading stored information with a certain accuracy. Noise analysis (Fig 6D) shows robustness, but not in terms of memory readout fidelity.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
       *  Justification: The concept of explicit memory readout accuracy is not applicable to this type of embodied, structural memory.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: Variable (Inverse of lifetime)
    *   Units: (time steps)^-1
    *   Justification: Memory degradation corresponds to the decay or destruction of the emergent structures. The rate depends on factors like environmental density (Fig 5B/C, Fig 6C) and noise (Fig 6D). It can be implicitly calculated as the inverse of the retention time/lifetime. For example, at DPE=0.03, median degradation rate is ~1/2346 steps^-1.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
            * Justification: Degradation rate is not explicitly calculated, but it's the inverse of the explicitly measured lifetimes (M3.3).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `degradation_rate` of `MemoryNode`.

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Structure Formation | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | N/A                   | N/A               | Energy cost of forming/maintaining structures (memory states) is not quantified. |
    | Structure Decay     | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | N/A                   | N/A               | Energy cost/release associated with structure destruction is not quantified. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper does not quantify energy costs associated with the formation, maintenance, or decay of structures (which represent the memory states).

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | Robustness to Noise | Median lifetime vs. noise std dev (σ) | See Fig 6D | steps | Attribute `robustness_noise` of `MemoryNode` | Fig 6D | Explicit | Quantifies persistence (memory retention) under actuation noise. |
    | State Stability (Lifetime vs DPE) | Median lifetime vs. DPE | See Fig 6C | steps | Attribute `stability_DPE` of `MemoryNode` | Fig 6C | Explicit | Measures persistence (memory retention) dependence on environment. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
*   Justification: The paper explicitly analyzes the robustness of cell lifetime (memory retention) against actuation noise (Fig 6D) and environmental density (Fig 6C), providing quantitative data.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: This is the central claim and phenomenon studied. The paper demonstrates that macroscopic ordered structures (spores, cells) and dynamics (life cycle, ecosystem) emerge spontaneously from the local interaction rule (Eq. 1) applied to initially randomly distributed particles, without any external blueprint or global control imposing this order. The order arises *from* the interactions.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Explicitly stated throughout the paper (Abstract: "self-structuring patterns...", "emergence is waiting for full understanding", "leading to a self-structuring, self-reproducing and self-sustaining life-like system"; Intro: "spontaneous emergence of self-sustaining and self-reproducing protocells"; Discussion: "emerge by self-organization from a simple mechanistic microscopic motion law").

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The primary local interaction rule is Equation 1: ∆Φ/∆t = α + β ⋅ N<sub>t,r</sub> ⋅ sign(R<sub>t,r</sub> − L<sub>t,r</sub>). Each particle senses other particles within a radius 'r'. It counts the number of neighbors to its left (L<sub>t,r</sub>) and right (R<sub>t,r</sub>) relative to its current heading. The total number of neighbors is N<sub>t,r</sub> = L<sub>t,r</sub> + R<sub>t,r</sub>. The change in heading (Δφ) per time step (Δt=1) is determined by a constant turn rate (α) plus a term proportional to the total neighbor count (β * N<sub>t,r</sub>), with the direction determined by whether there are more neighbors to the right (positive sign, turn right) or left (negative sign, turn left). After updating the heading, the particle moves forward a distance 'v' in the new direction: p<sub>t+1</sub> = p<sub>t</sub> + (cos(φ<sub>t+1</sub>), sin(φ<sub>t+1</sub>)) * v. Interactions are purely based on relative positions within radius 'r'.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `InteractionEdge` between `ComponentNode` (Particle) pairs within radius 'r'. Edge attributes: `rule`="Eq.1", `parameters`=['α', 'β', 'r', 'v']. The calculation involves aggregating information from multiple incoming edges at each node (particle).
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: Equation 1 and the descriptions of L, R, N, r, α, β, v, and the update process are explicitly provided in the Methods section and Figure 1.

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------ | :---------- | :------------- | :-------------------: | :---: | :----------: | :----------------: | :------------: |
    | Eq.1    | Interaction Rule | r              | 5 (default), Variable | space units | Methods      | Explicit         | Defines sensing range. |
    | Eq.1    | Interaction Rule | α              | 180 (default), [-180, 180] | degrees | Methods, Fig 7 | Explicit         | Constant rotation component. |
    | Eq.1    | Interaction Rule | β              | 17 (default), [-60, 60] | degrees | Methods, Fig 7 | Explicit         | Density-dependent rotation factor. |
    | Eq.1    | Interaction Rule | v              | 0.67 (default), Variable | space units/time step | Methods      | Explicit         | Particle speed. |
    | N/A     | Update Mechanism | Update Order   | Randomized            | N/A   | Methods      | Explicit         | Defines asynchronicity. |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The emergent global order includes:
        1.  **Spatial Structures:** Formation of distinct, persistent structures like 'premature spores', 'mature spores' (compact aggregates), and 'cells' (ring-like or triangle-like structures with internal density variations).
        2.  **Dynamic Patterns:** A characteristic life cycle (spore -> cell -> growth -> replication -> spore/death).
        3.  **Population Dynamics:** Logistic (sigmoidal) growth of the cell/spore population towards a carrying capacity.
        4.  **Ecosystem Formation:** Emergence of a "nutrient cycle" where free particles are consumed for growth and released upon decay, creating a self-sustaining system with resource competition.
        5.  Quasi-crystalline patterns at low densities (Fig 2C).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `ConfigurationalNode` types: `Spore`, `Cell`, `Ecosystem`. Attributes can include size, density, shape descriptors, population counts. Edges represent transitions (e.g., `GrowsInto`, `ReplicatesInto`, `DecaysInto`).
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: These emergent structures and dynamics (spores, cells, life cycle, logistic growth, nutrient cycle) are explicitly described, analyzed, and visualized throughout the Results section (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5).

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: Within the "region of life" parameters (Fig 7), the emergence of structures like spores and cells is highly predictable, though the exact timing and location can vary due to initial random conditions. Population dynamics follow predictable logistic growth (Fig 3H). Cell size and lifetime show predictable dependencies on environmental density (Fig 6). The system exhibits deterministic chaos at certain densities (Fig 2D), reducing predictability locally. Parameter sweeps (Fig 7) show distinct regions of behavior, indicating predictability based on parameters. Noise analysis (Fig 6D) shows behavior degrades predictably with increasing noise. Score is high but not 10 due to the stochastic elements from initial conditions and potential chaotic dynamics. Quantitative predictability metrics (e.g., R-squared for logistic fit in Fig 3H) are provided for some aspects.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: The predictability of logistic growth (R-squared implicitly high from fit), structure formation within the RoL, and dependencies on DPE/noise are explicitly shown or stated. The overall predictability score is an interpretation based on this evidence, acknowledging inherent stochasticity.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes to `AdjunctionEdge` weight (linking local rules `InteractionEdge` to global state `ConfigurationalNode`). Represents the reliability of the local-to-global mapping.

### **4.5. Local Interaction Rules (for Self-Organization)**
* **Vector ID:** M4.5
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Rule ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |

| Eq.1    | Particle Heading Change | β         | [-60, 60] (17 default) | deg   | Explicit         | Controls density-dependent rotation. Varied in Fig 7. | Methods, Fig 7 |
| Eq.1    | Particle Sensing      | r         | 5 (default)         | space units | Explicit         | Defines local neighborhood size. | Methods |
| Motion  | Particle Movement     | v         | 0.67 (default)      | space units/step | Explicit    | Defines particle speed. | Methods |

### **4.6. Globally Emergent Order and Order Parameters**
* **Vector ID:** M4.6
* **Vector Type:** Table

| Property ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Protocol | Source |

| PopDyn      | Population Growth | Spore Count (X<sub>spores</sub>) | ~0 to >20 | count | Mixed | Explicitly measured (particle counts mapped to spores) and implicitly via logistic model fit (K<sub>spores</sub>). | Particle counting (color-based) + Size estimate (18 particles/spore) | Fig 3H, Methods |

| Structure   | Spore Size    | Particle Count per Spore | ~14 to ~22 (mean ~18) | count | Mixed | Explicit analysis (Supp Fig S4), explicit value used for modeling (18). | Particle counting in visually identified structures/color-based. | Supp Fig S4, Methods |

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | Local Rule -> Global Structure | How specific settings of α, β, r, v, DPE lead to specific structures (spores, cells, patterns) | Medium-High (within RoL, Fig 7) | N/A | DHI(t), Visual Identification | Mixed | Predictability assessed via parameter sweeps (Fig 7) and density studies (Fig 2). Formal Yoneda analysis not performed. | Figs 2, 7 |
    | Local Rule -> Population Dynamics | How local interactions lead to logistic growth and equilibrium | High (Fig 3H fit) | N/A | Logistic fit params (a, K), Population Counts | Explicit | Logistic model fits well to observed population dynamics. Formal Yoneda analysis not performed. | Fig 3H |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** DHI(t), Visual classification, Population counts, Logistic growth parameters (a, K), Structure lifetime/size distributions.
    *   **Justification:** The paper extensively studies the mapping from local rules/parameters to global emergent phenomena (structures, dynamics). Predictability is assessed through simulation and analysis (parameter sweeps, density studies, noise robustness). However, the formal mathematical framework of Yoneda embedding is not mentioned or applied in the paper. Therefore, assessing Yoneda Score or fulfillment is not possible based solely on the provided text.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: Computation is embodied in the physical dynamics goverened by Eq. 1. Each particle performs a calculation based on local information (neighbor counts L, R, N) to determine its next state (heading change Δφ). This information processing is intrinsic to the particle's interaction rule and influences its behavior, not dictated by an external controller manipulating the particles based on global state.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper focuses on emergent life-like behavior, not explicitly framing the particle interactions as "computation." However, the process described (sensing local density configuration -> applying Eq. 1 -> changing heading) fits the definition of embodied computation where the physics/rules perform information processing.

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog/Hybrid
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `ComputationNode`: attributes - `type`="Analog/Hybrid", `location`="Particle Level".
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The inputs (L, R, N are counts - digital) and parameters (α, β) are used in an equation (Eq. 1) operating in continuous space/angles, producing a continuous heading change Δφ. The sign function introduces non-linearity. It's best described as analog computation driven by discrete local counts within a continuous physical system.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: The basic computational operation performed by each particle is the evaluation of Equation 1: ΔΦ/Δt = α + β ⋅ N<sub>t,r</sub> ⋅ sign(R<sub>t,r</sub> − L<sub>t,r</sub>). This involves:
        1. Sensing/Counting: Determining L<sub>t,r</sub>, R<sub>t,r</sub>, N<sub>t,r</sub> within radius r.
        2. Comparison/Sign Function: Evaluating sign(R<sub>t,r</sub> − L<sub>t,r</sub>).
        3. Weighted Summation/Scaling: Calculating β ⋅ N<sub>t,r</sub> and adding α.

    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: Equation 1 is explicitly given as the core rule governing particle behavior change based on local sensing.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The particles react based on the *current* local configuration according to the fixed rule (Eq. 1). There is no evidence presented that particles or structures maintain an internal model of their environment, predict future states, or select actions to minimize a prediction error or free energy functional in the sense required by Active Inference. The behavior, while complex and adaptive at the population level, appears purely reactive at the individual particle level based on the described mechanism.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The absence of mechanisms corresponding to Active Inference (prediction, internal models, error minimization driving action) is inferred from the provided description of the particle rules and system dynamics.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Partial
    *   Justification: The system exhibits adaptation at the *population* and *structural* level, but not plasticity in the individual particle rules.
        1.  **Population Adaptation:** The population size adapts to the carrying capacity (K) determined by particle density (DPE), following logistic growth (Fig 3H). This is an emergent adaptation.
        2.  **Structural Adaptation:** Cell size distribution adapts to DPE (Fig 6A,B), and cell lifetime adapts to DPE (Fig 6C). Replication time adapts to DPE (Fig 5A). Individual structures change size (grow/shrink) based on particle availability.
        However, the underlying interaction rules (Eq. 1) for individual particles do not change based on experience (no learning/rule plasticity). The adaptation arises from the fixed rules operating in different environmental contexts (DPE).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: Population adaptation (logistic growth) and structural adaptation (size/lifetime vs DPE) are explicit findings. The judgment that this constitutes only "Partial" adaptive plasticity (due to fixed underlying rules) is an interpretation based on the definition provided.

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The mechanism is emergent adaptation based on resource availability and density-dependent dynamics governed by fixed local rules (Eq. 1).
        *   **Population Level:** Higher density (DPE) provides more "nutrients" (free particles), increasing growth and replication rates (Fig 5A, 5D) and supporting a larger carrying capacity (Fig 3H relates K to density implicitly). Competition for limited particles creates density-dependent growth limitation (logistic model).
        *   **Structural Level:** Individual cells grow by incorporating free particles. Growth rate and stable size depend on the availability of these particles (DPE). Higher DPE leads to larger, longer-lived cells (Fig 6). The adaptation is a consequence of the balance between particle influx (attraction/capture) and efflux (intrinsic pressure/breakup) dictated by Eq. 1 under varying external densities. It's systemic adaptation, not rule modification.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `AdaptationNode`: attributes - `type`="Emergent/Systemic", `mechanism`="Density-Dependent Dynamics". Edges connect `EnvironmentNode` (DPE) to `ConfigurationalNode` (Cell/Spore/Ecosystem) via `AdaptationNode`. This is *not* adaptation in the sense of learning/plasticity of individual component rules.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The dependence of growth, size, and lifetime on DPE is explicitly shown (Figs 3H, 5, 6). The interpretation of the underlying mechanism as emergent adaptation based on fixed rules and resource availability is explicit in the discussion but synthesized here.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The main functional behaviors are:
        1.  **Self-Assembly/Structure Formation:** Spontaneous formation of persistent spores and cells from random initial conditions.
        2.  **Growth:** Structures (spores, cells) increase in size by consuming free particles.
        3.  **Self-Replication:** Cells divide into daughter cells (or produce spores).
        4.  **Life Cycle:** Structures progress through distinct stages (free particle -> spore -> cell -> growth -> replication -> death/decay -> free particle).
        5.  **Motility:** Structures (particularly spores) exhibit directed or collective movement (Fig 2B). Cells move slowly (Fig 2G-I).
        6.  **Interaction:** Structures repel each other after replication (Fig 2I); competition for free particles occurs.
        7.  **Ecosystem Dynamics:** Population regulation via density-dependent growth/decay, emergence of a nutrient cycle.
        8.  **Pattern Formation:** Hexagonal spacing at low density (Fig 2C); specific internal arrangements in cells (Figs 2G, 4F).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: `SelfAssembly`, `Growth`, `SelfReplication`, `LifeCycle`, `Motility`, `Interaction`, `EcosystemDynamics`, `PatternFormation`. These nodes are associated with `ConfigurationalNode`s (Spore, Cell, Ecosystem).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: All listed behaviors are explicitly described, analyzed, and visualized in the paper (Abstract, Results, Discussion, Figs 2-7).

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The emergence of life-like structures and dynamics is shown to be robust within a specific parameter region ("region of life", Fig 7). Key behaviors like cell survival and population persistence are robust to significant levels of actuation noise (up to σ ≈ 30°-40° standard deviation in heading change, Fig 6D). Structures persist over long timescales (10^6 steps, Fig 3H). However, behavior is sensitive to parameters outside the RoL (Fig 7) and highly dependent on environmental density (DPE), with critical thresholds for replication and survival (Fig 5, Fig 6C). Sensitivity to initial conditions exists but doesn't prevent eventual emergence of characteristic structures/dynamics within the RoL.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Robustness to noise (Fig 6D), parameter variations (Fig 7 analysis), and long-term persistence (Fig 3H) are explicitly studied. Dependence on DPE (Figs 5, 6) is also explicitly shown. The overall score is an interpretation synthesizing these findings.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `robustness_score` of `BehaviorArchetypeNode`. Attributes `noise_tolerance` (from Fig 6D) and `parameter_sensitivity` (from Fig 7) contribute.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Claims of emergence are validated through:
        1.  **Direct Simulation & Visualization:** Time-lapse sequences (Fig 2, Fig 3A-G, Supp Video 1) visually demonstrate the formation, growth, replication, and interaction of structures from random initial conditions.
        2.  **Quantitative Analysis:** Measuring structure properties (size distributions in Supp Fig S4, Fig 6A/B), population dynamics (counts over time, Fig 3H), structure lifetimes (Fig 6C), replication times (Fig 5A), internal particle configurations (phase plots in Fig 4), and spatial homogeneity (DHI index, Fig 7).
        3.  **Parameter Sweeps:** Exploring the effect of key parameters (α, β in Fig 7; DPE in Figs 5, 6) to map regions where specific behaviors occur and assess sensitivity ("region of life").
        4.  **Robustness Testing:** Introducing noise into particle actuation and measuring the impact on structure lifetime (Fig 6D).
        5.  **Control Comparisons (Implicit):** Different densities (Fig 2) and parameter settings (Fig 7) serve as implicit controls, showing that specific conditions are required for the "life-like" behaviors.
        Limitations: Validation relies entirely on simulation; no physical experiment. Some analyses use estimated parameters (e.g., typical cell size for population counts). Reproducibility across different simulation platforms isn't discussed.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The methods used for validation (simulation, quantitative analysis of various metrics, parameter sweeps, noise testing) are explicitly described in the Methods and Results sections and figure captions.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, the paper extensively uses analogies to biological/cognitive processes:
        *   Structures are called "protocells" and "spores".
        *   Free particles are called "nutrients".
        *   The overall system dynamics are described as an "ecosystem" with "population dynamics", "nutrient cycle", "carrying capacity", and "intra-specific competition".
        *   Structures undergo a "life cycle" including "morphogenesis", "reproduction", "growth", and "death".
        *   Internal particle dynamics are referred to as "internal physiology" (Fig 3I,J caption).
        *   Resilience to noise is linked to stability/homeostasis.
        The mapping is primarily metaphorical, linking observed emergent dynamics in the simulation to analogous processes in living systems, particularly at the level of cells and ecology. The limitations are that these are analogies based on behavioral resemblance, not necessarily shared underlying mechanisms with biological cognition.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge`s connecting `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s (SelfReplication, Growth, EcosystemDynamics, LifeCycle) and `ConfigurationalNode`s (Cell, Spore) to `CognitiveFunctionNode`s (e.g., "Reproduction", "Metabolism", "Ecological Interaction", "Development") or `BiologicalAnalogueNode`s ("Cell", "Spore", "Ecosystem").
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly uses terms like "protocells", "spores", "life cycle", "ecosystem", "nutrient cycle", "physiology", "competition", "reproduction", "death", etc., throughout the text (Abstract, Intro, Results, Discussion) and figure captions to describe the system's behavior.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: Based on the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:
        *   The system demonstrates clear **Level 1 (Simple Responsivity)** as particles react to local density.
        *   It exhibits **Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity)** through emergent self-assembly, growth, replication, and population-level adaptation (density dependence). These resemble basic biological processes below the level of complex organismal cognition.
        *   It *partially* touches on **Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy)** in the sense that the structures persist, reproduce, and compete autonomously within the simulation, adapting population size to resources. However, the behavioral repertoire is very limited, and adaptation is systemic, not individual learning.
        *   There is no evidence of goal-directed behavior based on internal models (Level 4+). Particles and structures react based on immediate local conditions and fixed rules. No planning, representation, symbolic reasoning, or self-awareness is demonstrated or claimed beyond analogy.
        The score of 2 reflects strong sub-organismal behaviors resembling basic life functions but lacking hallmarks of higher cognitive processes like model-based reasoning or flexible decision-making. The analogies used are primarily behavioral, not indicative of deep cognitive similarity.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is an interpretation based on applying the provided Cognizance Scale rubric to the behaviors explicitly described and demonstrated in the paper, critically evaluating the biological analogies used.

    | Decision-Making/Planning          |      0       | Particle behavior is reactive based on local state and fixed rules. No planning/choice. | N/A                                | Implicit         | Absence inferred from rule description (Eq. 1). |

    | Goal-Directed Behavior            |      0       | Behavior emerges from local rules; no evidence of internal goals driving action selection. | N/A                                | Implicit         | Absence inferred from reactive rules. |
    | Model-Based Reasoning              |      0       | No evidence of internal world models used for prediction or reasoning.                | N/A                                | Implicit         | Absence inferred from model description. |
    | **Overall score**                 |     0.9      | Low overall score reflects primarily reactive system with emergent basic life-like functions, lacking higher cognitive capabilities. | N/A                                | Implicit         | Calculated average reflects component scores. |

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear/Partial
    *   Justification: The paper mentions "emergence of order from chaos" and "phase transitions" (Fig 7 caption) which are concepts related to criticality. The parameter sweep (Fig 7) identifies a specific "region of life" bordering other behavioral regimes, suggesting the life-like behavior might occur near a phase transition boundary. The Discussion also references Langton's "computation at the edge of chaos". However, the paper does not provide quantitative evidence typically associated with criticality, such as power-law distributions, scale-free correlations, or divergence of susceptibility measures. The DHI index measures inhomogeneity but isn't a standard criticality metric.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): α, β (parameters defining proximity to phase transitions in Fig 7). Particle Density (DPE) also seems critical for behavior transitions (Figs 2, 5).
        *   Evidence: Fig 7 shows distinct behavioral regimes in the α-β parameter space, implying phase transitions. Discussion mentions "edge of chaos". Lack of formal criticality analysis (power laws, correlation lengths, etc.).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *    Justification: Explicit mention of related concepts ("order from chaos", "phase transitions", "edge of chaos") and explicit demonstration of different behavioral regimes sensitive to parameters (Fig 7). The assessment as "Unclear/Partial" is due to the lack of explicit, quantitative analysis confirming operation *at* a critical point using standard measures.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: The paper presents a compelling computational model (PPS) demonstrating the emergence of complex, "life-like" behaviors (self-assembly, growth, replication, ecosystem dynamics) from remarkably simple local interaction rules governing self-propelled particles. Its key strengths lie in the clear demonstration of self-organization (M4), the explicit characterization of emergent structures and their life cycles (M4.3, M8.1), and the analysis of system robustness against noise and parameter variations (M8.2, Fig 6D, Fig 7). The system embodies a basic form of computation (M5) and structural memory (M3) through persistent particle configurations. However, its limitations from a CT-GIN perspective are significant. Energy flow is only implicitly modeled (M2), hindering efficiency analysis. The embodied memory is low-capacity and non-addressable (M3). Adaptation is purely systemic/emergent based on fixed rules, lacking individual learning or rule plasticity (M7). Computation is limited to the reactive evaluation of the local interaction rule (M5). Consequently, the system scores low on cognitive proximity (M9), exhibiting sub-organismal responsivity (Level 2) rather than higher cognitive functions. Overall, PPS is a valuable minimal model for studying emergence and self-organization, providing a strong foundation in M4 and M8, but requires significant extension to address memory fidelity, energy efficiency, adaptive learning, and computational depth relevant to higher levels of material intelligence within the CT-GIN framework.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically about spatial scales (interaction radius `r` vs. system size vs. structure size) could be useful for self-organization analysis.
        *   A probe contrasting deterministic vs. stochastic elements in the dynamics might be helpful.
        *   For computational models, a probe on the simulation method (e.g., time integration scheme, boundary conditions handling details) could enhance implementation clarity.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Adaptability/Learning" (M3.B in background doc) and "Adaptation" (M7) could be clearer. M7 focuses on plasticity, while M3.B seems broader. Perhaps combine or clarify the scope.
        *   The definition of "memory" is functional but might benefit from explicitly distinguishing between state persistence (like in physics) and information encoding/retrieval (like in computation).
        *   The precise meaning and calculation method for the "Yoneda Score" (M4.7) is unclear and seems highly theoretical; its applicability to general papers needs justification or simplification/removal.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance could be more specific on *how* to represent dynamic processes (like growth, replication) involving multiple nodes/states over time within a static graph representation. Should intermediate states be nodes?
        *   Mapping parameters like α, β, r, v: Should they be attributes of rules/interactions, or separate parameter nodes? The template example suggests attributes, but parameter nodes might be clearer for analysis across papers. (I used both for clarity here).
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Scoring "Energy Efficiency" (M2.3) is often impossible for theoretical/computational models lacking explicit energy modeling; marking as N/A was necessary but feels unsatisfying. Perhaps make it conditional or provide clearer guidance for N/A cases.
        *   Scoring "Memory Capacity" (M3.4) for embodied/structural memory is inherently fuzzy. The rubric needs clearer guidelines or examples for non-computational memory types.
        *   Predictability (M4.4) and Robustness (M8.2) scores rely heavily on interpretation if not explicitly quantified with standard metrics in the paper. More defined scales or reliance on qualitative justification might be better.
        *   Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2): The scale is useful, but mapping complex system behavior to a single linear scale is challenging. Providing sub-scores based on M9.3 might be more informative.
        *   The instruction "scores with N/A convert in 0" for M13.1 might unfairly penalize papers where a metric is genuinely not applicable (like M2.3 here), rather than just missing. Excluding N/A from the average might be better.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Extracting *all* relevant parameters and their sources into tables (M1.3, M4.2.1, etc.) can be tedious and might duplicate information. Streamlining might be possible.
        *   Ensuring strict adherence to "No extraneous text" is challenging, especially for justifications requiring nuanced explanation.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is extremely detailed and comprehensive, which is good for standardization. However, its length and the need for interpretation (especially for CT/GIN mapping and scores) make it demanding to apply accurately and consistently. A slightly simpler version focusing only on core, frequently available metrics might be more practical for large-scale analysis, with the detailed version reserved for in-depth studies. The strict formatting is crucial but unforgiving.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        * Clarify handling of N/A vs. 0 scores in M13.1 calculation.
        * Simplify or remove M4.7 (Yoneda Score) unless specifically targeting papers using CT formalism.
        * Provide more examples for CT-GIN mapping, especially for dynamic processes and non-computational memory/adaptation types.
        * Consider making energy efficiency (M2.3) conditional on explicit energy modeling.
        * Refine scoring rubrics for memory capacity, predictability, and robustness for non-standard cases.
