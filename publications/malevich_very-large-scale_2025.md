### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system is a very-large-scale spatial light modulator (SLM) for Terahertz (THz) and millimeter (mm) waves. It consists of an active-matrix array of 640x480 individually addressable subwavelength pixels (>300,000 total). Each pixel integrates a graphene-based THz modulator with thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane electronics. The core modulator structure involves laminated layers: a bilayer graphene top electrode, an ionic liquid electrolyte layer (~5µm or ~25µm thick porous membrane), and an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) pixel electrode connected via the TFT. The TFT (amorphous-Si, double-back-gate) controls the charge on a pixel capacitor, which dictates the local charge density (holes/electrons) on the continuous graphene layer via electrolyte gating. Modulating the graphene's charge density tunes its Drude-like metallic response, thereby controlling the reflection and transmission of incident THz/mm-waves. The purpose is to dynamically manipulate THz/mm-waves in real-time for applications like imaging and next-generation communications, enabling programmable transmission/reflection patterns, beam steering, and pattern generation for techniques like single-pixel imaging.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: THz/mm-wave Spatial Light Modulator, `domain`: Electromagnetics/Materials Science, `mechanism`: Electrostatic Gating (TFT + Electrolyte) of Graphene, `components`: Bilayer Graphene, Ionic Liquid Electrolyte, TFT Active Matrix (a-Si), ITO Electrodes, Polymer Substrates (PET), Control Electronics (Display Driver, Microcontroller), `purpose`: Dynamic control of THz/mm-waves (transmission/reflection patterns, beam steering, imaging).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the system's components, structure, operating principle, scale, and purpose throughout the abstract, introduction, Fig. 1 description, and methods sections.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper provides a clear description of the device architecture (Fig. 1a), materials used (graphene, electrolyte, PET, ITO, a-Si TFT), fabrication steps (Methods), basic operating principle (gating mechanism), and experimental setups (Figs. 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a). Key parameters like pixel count, pixel size, layer thicknesses, and TFT characteristics are given. Schematics and photos aid understanding. Some details of the display driver interface and specific control algorithms (e.g., for grayscale generation, Hadamard patterns) are in supplementary materials or briefly mentioned, slightly reducing clarity within the main text alone. Electromagnetic simulations are mentioned but detailed methods are in Supplementary Information.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: Most implementation details (device structure, materials, basic operation, setups) are explicitly stated and illustrated. Some finer details regarding control electronics programming and simulation specifics rely on supplementary information, making the clarity within the main text partially implicit regarding those aspects.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy input is electrical energy supplied to the active-matrix TFT backplane and the graphene layer. This includes: (1) Voltages (V_DH, V_DL) applied to drain lines, (2) Voltage pulses applied to gate lines to control the TFTs, (3) Common voltage (V_G) applied to the graphene layer, (4) Power for the chip-on-glass display driver and external microcontroller. The system also interacts with electromagnetic energy in the THz/mm-wave range, which is modulated but not the primary energy input for *operation*.
    *   Value: Voltage levels mentioned: V_DL = -2.4 V, V_DH = 10 V (Fig. 3b,c). Specific power consumption is not quantified.
    *   Units: Volts (V) for potentials. Power units (Watts) not provided.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Electrical Power Supply, `type`: Electrical Voltage/Current. Secondary interaction with `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: THz/mm-wave Emitter, `type`: Electromagnetic Radiation.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The use of electrical voltages (V_G, V_DH, V_DL, gate pulses) is explicitly stated (Fig. 1, Results). The need for power for the driver/microcontroller is implicit based on standard electronics. The interaction with THz/mm-waves is explicit. Quantification of power consumption is absent.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: 1. Electrical energy (gate pulse) -> Controls TFT conductivity. 2. Electrical energy (drain voltage, V_DH/V_DL) + TFT state -> Charges/discharges pixel capacitor. 3. Electrical potential energy (stored in capacitor) + V_G -> Creates electric field across electrolyte. 4. Electric field -> Ion movement in electrolyte -> Changes charge carrier density in graphene layer (Electrostatic Doping). 5. Change in graphene charge density -> Modulates graphene's complex conductivity (Drude response) at THz/mm-wave frequencies. 6. Modulated graphene conductivity -> Alters reflection/transmission coefficient for incident THz/mm-wave electromagnetic energy.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: `mechanism`: TFT Switching, `from_node`: GateVoltageInput, `to_node`: TFTState. `EnergyTransductionEdge`: `mechanism`: Capacitor Charging, `from_node`: DrainVoltageInput, `to_node`: PixelCapacitorCharge. `EnergyTransductionEdge`: `mechanism`: Electrolyte Gating, `from_node`: PixelCapacitorCharge, `to_node`: GrapheneChargeDensity. `EnergyTransductionEdge`: `mechanism`: Drude Response Modulation, `from_node`: GrapheneChargeDensity, `to_node`: GrapheneTHzConductivity. `EnergyTransductionEdge`: `mechanism`: THz Wave Interaction, `from_node`: GrapheneTHzConductivity, `to_node`: ModulatedTHzWave.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The sequence of operations involving TFTs controlling pixel voltage, electrolyte gating modulating graphene charge density, and graphene charge modulating THz response is explicitly described in the introduction, Fig. 1 description, and Results sections. The physical mechanisms (TFT switching, capacitor charging, electrostatic gating, Drude response) are standard concepts applied here.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification/Metrics: Efficiency is not explicitly quantified in terms of electrical power input vs. modulated THz power output. However, the paper notes significant insertion loss, particularly for multi-layer graphene devices (Fig. 2c). THz transmission is stated as ~30% at 100 GHz even *before* modulation (implicit high baseline loss, Supporting Materials Fig. S5 mentioned). Modulation itself relies on changing graphene's absorption/reflection, which implies energy loss within the graphene layer when it is conductive. The reflection singularity operation (Fig. 3) involves tunable *absorption*. While effective for modulation, this implies potentially low energy efficiency in terms of reflected/transmitted power vs. incident power during certain states. The electrical efficiency of the TFT array is likely standard for a-Si display technology but not discussed. Overall assessment: Low efficiency due to inherent THz absorption and insertion losses.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `efficiency` (Low) or `insertion_loss` (High) of `EnergyTransductionEdge` mapping THz modulation.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
      *  Justification: Insertion loss/low transmission (~30% at 100GHz) is explicitly mentioned or referenced (SM Fig S5). The concept of tunable absorption being linked to the reflection singularity mechanism is explicit (Fig 3). The conclusion that this implies low energy efficiency in terms of throughput is implicit. Electrical efficiency is not discussed (implicit N/A). Score is based on these factors.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Dissipation mechanisms include: 1. Resistive losses (Joule heating) in TFT channels, ITO electrodes, metal lines, and the graphene layer itself (especially when doped to be conductive). 2. Dielectric losses in the capacitor dielectric and polymer layers. 3. Energy loss due to ion transport/friction within the electrolyte during gating. 4. Absorption of THz/mm-wave energy in the graphene layer (part of the modulation mechanism but also a loss pathway), substrate, and other layers. The paper does not quantify these losses. Qualitative assessment: Expected to be significant, particularly THz absorption in graphene and resistive losses in the large TFT array and electrodes.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode`s (e.g., Heat) and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s from various components (TFTs, Graphene, Electrodes, Dielectrics) with attributes `mechanism` (e.g., Joule Heating, THz Absorption, Dielectric Loss, Ionic Friction).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Standard dissipation mechanisms (resistive loss, dielectric loss, absorption) are known physical phenomena applicable to the described components (TFTs, capacitors, conductors, graphene). Ionic friction is relevant for electrolytes. These mechanisms are not explicitly listed or quantified as dissipation pathways in the paper, so their identification is implicit based on physical principles.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system exhibits memory because the state of each pixel (defined by the charge on its capacitor and thus the local graphene conductivity) persists after the gate pulse driving signal is removed. This stored charge configuration determines the spatial pattern of THz modulation, influencing the system's future interaction with THz waves until the pixel state is actively changed by the control electronics. The displayed pattern (e.g., letters, gratings) remains stable between refresh cycles.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The persistence of the displayed pattern is shown explicitly (Figs 2b, 3d-f). The underlying mechanism (charge storage on pixel capacitors governed by TFTs) is explicitly described (Fig 1). The interpretation of this state persistence as "memory" according to the definition (state persistence influencing future behavior) is implicit in the analysis but strongly supported by the explicit device physics.

**(Conditional: If M3.1 is "No", skip to Module 4. If "Yes", include M3.2 and M3.3.)**

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 4
*   Justification: The memory is essentially volatile digital/analog state storage at the pixel level. Each pixel capacitor holds a charge corresponding to a voltage level, which translates to a THz modulation state. The state is written electronically via the TFTs. It persists due to capacitor charge retention, limited by leakage currents (not quantified, but inherent in TFTs/capacitors) and the refresh rate of the display driver (200 Hz scan rate mentioned). Read-out is via the THz wave interaction. The system supports binary states (V_DH/V_DL) and grayscale (via superpixels), indicating multiple states are possible per functional unit (superpixel). It's re-writable. However, retention is likely relatively short-term (ms to s range, typical for display pixels without active refresh) compared to non-volatile memory types. Capacity is high due to the large number of pixels. Read-out accuracy depends on the THz measurement. It resembles DRAM pixels or basic sample-and-hold circuits. Score reflects re-writability and high capacity but likely volatile, short-term retention without active refresh.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type: `PixelState`. Attributes: `type`: Volatile Charge Storage, `mechanism`: Capacitor + TFT.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The mechanism (capacitor charge storage via TFTs) and programmability (binary/grayscale patterns) are explicit. The volatility and likely short retention time (without refresh) are implicit based on the known physics of TFT-capacitor pixels. The score is assigned based on blending these explicit and implicit characteristics against the definition of memory capabilities.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: ~milliseconds to seconds (Qualitative)
*    Units: Time
*   Justification: The paper doesn't explicitly state the retention time (how long a pixel holds its state without refresh). However, it mentions a scan rate of 200 Hz (Results), implying a refresh cycle of 5 ms. The pixel charging/discharging time is ~1 ms (Fig. 2e). Typical a-Si TFT pixel circuits used in displays have retention times sufficient to hold state between refresh cycles (ms range), but significant leakage occurs over longer periods (seconds) without refresh. Therefore, the functional memory retention is tied to the refresh cycle (ms), while passive retention might be longer but is not characterized.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The refresh rate (200 Hz -> 5 ms cycle) is explicit. Pixel switching time (~1ms) is explicit. The inference that memory retention is tied to this refresh cycle and likely limited to ms/seconds without refresh is based on standard knowledge of TFT display technology, which is not explicitly stated in the paper.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute `retention_time` of the `MemoryNode` (`PixelState`).

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: >300,000 (pixels) * log2(N_states)
*   Units: bits (approx.)
*   Justification: The system has 640x480 = 307,200 individually addressable pixels. Each pixel can be set to at least two states (V_DH, V_DL). Grayscale is achieved using 3x3 superpixels, allowing 10 distinct average states per superpixel. If considering binary pixels, capacity is >300k bits. If considering grayscale superpixels (307200/9 ~ 34k superpixels), capacity is ~34k * log2(10) ~ 113k bits. The fundamental capacity is based on the individual pixels. N_states depends on whether considering binary or achievable analog levels.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Pixel count (640x480) is explicit. Binary operation is explicit. Grayscale via 3x3 superpixels is explicit. Calculating capacity in bits involves combining explicit numbers (pixel count) with an implicit interpretation of distinguishable states (binary or grayscale levels).
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute `capacity` of the `MemoryNode` (`PixelState`) or `SystemNode`.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A (Qualitative: Sufficient for imaging/beam steering shown)
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: Readout accuracy (how well the measured THz signal corresponds to the stored pixel state) is not explicitly quantified. However, the successful demonstrations of imaging (Fig. 2b, Fig. 4b,c) and pattern generation (Fig. 3d-f) imply that the readout via THz interaction is accurate enough to distinguish the programmed states and reconstruct the intended patterns or images. Factors like noise in the THz source/detector, diffraction effects, and pixel crosstalk would affect accuracy but are not parameterized in this way.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
       *  Justification: Readout accuracy is not numerically specified. The assessment is inferred from the success of the demonstrated applications (imaging, pattern generation) shown explicitly in figures.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `readout_fidelity` of `MemoryNode` or related `ReadoutEdge`.

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper does not discuss the degradation of the memory state (charge leakage over time beyond the refresh cycle) or the degradation of the device itself over repeated switching cycles.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Absence of information)
            * Justification: The paper does not provide data or discussion on memory degradation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Write (Pixel Set)   | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A              | N/A                   | Explicit (Absence) | Energy cost not quantified. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Absence of information)
    *   Justification: The paper does not quantify the energy cost associated with writing or maintaining the memory state.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | N/A       | Paper does not provide specific quantitative metrics for memory fidelity or robustness beyond demonstrating functional patterns. | N/A   | N/A   | N/A             | N/A          | Explicit (Absence) | No specific metrics reported. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Absence of information)
*   Justification: The paper lacks quantitative metrics characterizing memory fidelity or robustness (e.g., bit error rate, state stability under noise).

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The spatial patterns generated by the device (letters, gratings, images) are explicitly programmed and imposed externally via the chip-on-glass display driver and microcontroller. The system executes these pre-defined patterns. While the pixel operation relies on local physics (TFT switching, gating), the global order (the displayed pattern) is dictated by external control signals, not by spontaneous emergence from local interactions without global definition. The structure itself (TFT array, graphene layer) is fabricated through standard top-down processes, not self-organization.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The external programming of patterns is explicitly stated or shown (e.g., mention of microcontroller, display driver, input images for patterns like Queen Elizabeth II). The definition of self-organization (spontaneous emergence from local rules without external pattern definition) is applied, leading to the conclusion "No", which is an interpretation (implicit) based on the explicit description of how patterns are generated.

**(Conditional: If M4.1 is "No", skip to Module 5. If "Yes", include M4.2-M4.7)**

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: Computation is not performed intrinsically by the active material (graphene) itself based on its physical properties in a novel way. The TFT array performs switching logic (computation), but this uses standard semiconductor technology integrated *with* the graphene modulator. The graphene's role is modulation based on the computed state (charge density) from the TFT array. The overall system *enables* computation (e.g., image reconstruction in single-pixel camera uses computation *based on* the patterns generated), but this computation happens externally (in the reconstruction algorithm). The material system acts as a programmable mask or interface, not as the primary computing element itself.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The system description explicitly details the role of TFTs (switching) and graphene (modulation). The use of the device in a single-pixel camera setup involving computational reconstruction is explicit. The interpretation that the computation is not *embodied* within the graphene's physics itself, but rather performed by the integrated conventional TFTs or external algorithms, is implicit based on the definition of embodied computation.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system does not exhibit active inference. It does not appear to possess an internal model of its environment, nor does it predict future states or select actions to minimize prediction error autonomously. Its behavior (the displayed pattern) is directly determined by external commands from the microcontroller/driver, implementing pre-defined patterns for specific applications (imaging, beam steering). There is no evidence of goal-directed behavior emerging from internal predictive processing.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper describes a system driven by external control signals to generate specific patterns. The absence of any mention of internal models, prediction, or autonomous error minimization leads to the inference that Active Inference is not present.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system's behavior is reconfigurable (patterns can be changed), but it does not demonstrate adaptive plasticity. There is no evidence that the system changes its internal structure or fundamental response characteristics based on experience or environmental interaction to improve performance over time. The relationship between pixel voltage and THz modulation appears fixed by the device physics and material properties established during fabrication. The patterns are changed by external command, not by an internal adaptation process.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The paper focuses on demonstrating reconfigurability and various applications based on fixed material responses. The absence of any description of learning, training, performance improvement over time, or structural changes due to experience leads to the inference that adaptive plasticity is not present.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary functional behaviors are: 1. Spatially Resolved Modulation: Generating arbitrary, programmable 2D patterns of THz/mm-wave transmission and reflection intensity/phase. 2. Dynamic Beam Steering: Creating programmable diffraction gratings (binary, fork) to control the direction and shape (e.g., introducing orbital angular momentum) of THz/mm-wave beams. 3. Structured Illumination/Imaging: Generating specific patterns (e.g., Hadamard masks) for use in computational imaging techniques like single-pixel cameras. These behaviors arise directly from the collective, programmed states of the individual pixel modulators.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: "SpatialLightModulation", "BeamSteering", "StructuredIllumination". Attributes describe parameters like resolution, frequency range, modulation depth, steering range.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors (pattern generation, beam steering, single-pixel imaging) are explicitly demonstrated and described as the key functionalities and applications of the device in the Results section and Figures 2, 3, 4, 5.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The paper mentions "unprecedented levels of uniformity and reproducibility" in generating patterns (Abstract), suggesting robustness in basic operation under controlled conditions. Demonstrations involve large areas and complex patterns (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5), indicating functional robustness. However, robustness to environmental noise (temperature fluctuations, vibrations), pixel defects/failures, or variations in input THz signal is not explicitly quantified or discussed. The use of a common voltage (V_G) to compensate for unintentional doping suggests a need for calibration, potentially indicating sensitivity to fabrication variations. Performance dependence on frequency is shown (Fig 2c, Fig 3b,c). Score reflects demonstrated functional robustness and uniformity but acknowledges lack of characterization against noise, defects, or environmental variables.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Claims of uniformity and reproducibility are explicit. The successful complex demonstrations imply functional robustness (implicit). The lack of testing against specific perturbations (noise, defects) is explicit (by omission). The need for V_G compensation is explicit. The score balances these points.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `robustness_score` of the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: The demonstrated behaviors (spatial modulation, beam steering, imaging) are validated through direct experimental measurements and imaging results presented in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5. For spatial modulation, THz camera images show the generated patterns (Fig. 2b). For reflection patterns and phase modulation, raster-scanned time-domain THz spectroscopy maps the reflectivity (Fig. 3d-f). For beam steering, a THz camera images the diffracted beams at different programmed grating periods (Fig. 5b,c). For single-pixel imaging, reconstructed images of objects are shown, validating the use of generated Hadamard patterns (Fig. 4b,c), with convergence analysis (Fig. 4d). Control experiments comparing different graphene layers are presented (Fig. 2c). Reproducibility is claimed (Abstract) but not explicitly shown through repeated trials or statistics in the main text. Limitations include spatial resolution limits of the THz cameras/spectrometer and potential environmental factors not controlled/reported. These are validations of *programmed behaviors*, not *emergent* behaviors in the sense of arising spontaneously from local rules.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The validation methods (THz imaging, spectroscopy, reconstruction algorithms) and results are explicitly described and presented in the figures and corresponding text.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: None. The paper does not attempt to map the system's functionality to cognitive processes. It describes the device as a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) or spatial light modulator (SLM), framing its capabilities in terms of signal processing (modulation, beamforming) and imaging, without invoking analogies to biological cognition.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Absence of mapping)
    * Justification: The text focuses entirely on the physical implementation, performance, and applications in THz/mm-wave engineering, with no mention of cognitive analogies.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification: Based on the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale, the system primarily exhibits Level 1 (Simple Responsivity). It responds to external electrical control signals by modulating THz waves in a pre-programmed manner. While highly complex and reconfigurable, it lacks internal state beyond the stored pixel charges, adaptation, learning, prediction, goal-directed autonomy, or internal models. The "intelligence" in "reconfigurable intelligent surface" refers to its ability to be programmed to alter wave propagation adaptively *to the environment or communication channel needs*, but this adaptation logic resides externally, not within the material system itself. It acts as a sophisticated, programmable interface, not an autonomous cognitive agent.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is assigned by comparing the system's explicitly described functionalities (programmable modulation controlled externally) against the levels defined in the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale. This comparison and interpretation are implicit.

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Partial/Unclear
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly mentions operating around a reflection singularity associated with a topological phase transition to achieve large phase modulation (Results, Fig. 3). Singularities and phase transitions are often associated with critical phenomena. However, the paper does not analyze this behavior using the typical metrics of criticality (e.g., power-law scaling, long-range correlations, divergence of susceptibility). It describes the *outcome* (step-like phase jump, perfect absorption) rather than analyzing the underlying system dynamics *as* critical phenomena. Therefore, while the system might utilize physics related to critical points, it's unclear from the text if it operates *at* criticality in the formal sense or exhibits characteristic critical behaviors.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): Pixel Voltage (V_DL to V_DH) tunes the system through the singularity; Frequency (near resonance ~1.6-1.9 THz).
        *   Evidence: Fig. 3b,c show sharp changes in amplitude (absorption) and phase near the singularity as voltage is tuned. Text describes "topological switching" and "winding a singularity point".
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *    Justification: The operation near a singularity and the observation of phase jumps are explicit. The link to criticality is implicit and speculative, as the paper doesn't use criticality formalism or metrics. The parameters controlling the passage through singularity are explicit.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper demonstrates a technologically advanced large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for THz/mm-waves using graphene modulators integrated with TFT technology. Its key strengths lie in the high degree of spatial control (over 300,000 pixels), reconfigurability enabling diverse functionalities like dynamic beam steering and single-pixel imaging, and operation across a broad frequency range. From a CT-GIN perspective, the system exhibits basic memory (volatile pixel state retention) and complex, programmable responsiveness. However, it significantly lacks hallmarks of higher material intelligence. There is no evidence of self-organization, embodied computation intrinsic to the active material, adaptive plasticity, or active inference. The system operates under explicit external control, acting as a sophisticated, programmable interface rather than an autonomous entity. Energy efficiency appears low due to inherent losses. While showcasing impressive engineering and enabling capabilities in THz manipulation, the system's cognitive proximity is very low (Level 1), highlighting the gap between current RIS technology and truly cognizant matter. Its potential lies in providing a testbed for implementing more intelligent control algorithms externally, rather than exhibiting intelligence itself.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Integrate Local Feedback:** Explore incorporating local sensors (e.g., optical, thermal) within pixels to allow feedback based on local THz field intensity or environmental conditions, potentially enabling localized, autonomous adjustments rather than purely external programming.
        *   **Develop Intrinsic Memory:** Investigate modifications to the graphene/electrolyte system or integration of phase-change materials to achieve non-volatile memory states within pixels, moving beyond simple capacitor charge storage.
        *   **Explore Embodied Computation:** Research ways the physical dynamics of the graphene-electrolyte interface itself could perform basic computations (e.g., thresholding, local averaging) rather than relying solely on the TFTs for switching logic.
        *   **Quantify Robustness and Energy:** Systematically characterize the device's robustness to noise, pixel defects, and environmental variations. Quantify electrical energy consumption per operation/pixel state.
        *   **Investigate Adaptive Mechanisms:** Explore methods to introduce adaptive plasticity, perhaps through history-dependent gating protocols or materials whose properties change with repeated use or specific stimuli sequences.
        *   **Model Active Inference (External):** Use the RIS as a platform to implement external control algorithms based on active inference principles, where the RIS state is updated to minimize prediction errors in a communication or imaging task, even if the inference doesn't occur within the material itself.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically for "Reconfigurability" (distinct from Adaptation/Plasticity) might be useful, measuring the speed, energy cost, and range of achievable state changes.
        *   Consider adding a probe for "Control Interface" under M1, detailing how the system is programmed/controlled (e.g., external computer, embedded controller, API type).
        *   Under M8 (Behaviors), add a subsection for "Performance Metrics" with a table to capture quantitative measures specific to the behavior (e.g., for beam steering: steering range, beam quality; for SLM: contrast ratio, modulation depth vs frequency).
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Adaptation" (M7) and "Active Inference" (M6.2) could be slightly clarified, especially regarding the role of internal models. Active inference seems to imply a specific predictive coding mechanism for adaptation.
        *   The definition of "Embodied Computation" (M5.1) could be sharpened – does computation performed by standard integrated components (like TFTs here) count, or must it arise from novel physics of the primary material? Clarifying this would affect the Yes/No answer. (Assumed the latter for this analysis).
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:** Guidance is generally good, but providing a small library of common Node/Edge types (like shown in M14 description) within the template instructions could speed up mapping.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Scoring energy efficiency (M2.3) without explicit power consumption data is difficult; perhaps guideline metrics (e.g., based on insertion loss, known component efficiencies) could be provided.
        *   The Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on the interpretation of the scale; providing concrete examples for different score levels for material systems would be beneficial.
        *   Calculating M13.1 score requires clear handling of N/A scores (treated as 0 here, which might be harsh). Defining a consistent rule is needed.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:** The structure is logical. Explicitly requesting info sources (Fig/Table/Section) in M1.3, M6.1 and similar tables is very helpful. Condensing some optional sub-sections (e.g., within M3) if information is rarely available might streamline the template.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is comprehensive but very long. For rapid analysis, a "core" subset of modules might be useful. The conditional skipping helps manage length. The strict formatting is good for consistency but demanding.
    * **Specific Suggestions:** Add a field under M1.1 for "Key Innovation Claimed" to capture the paper's main contribution succinctly. Clarify the `####` probe heading instruction vs the template structure (followed template structure here).
