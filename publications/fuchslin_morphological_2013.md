## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper describes and aims to formalize the concepts of Morphological Computation (MC) and Morphological Control (MCon). MC is defined as the exploitation of a physical system's shape, material properties, and dynamics for computational purposes. MCon is the application of MC to control tasks. The core idea is outsourcing computation/control to the physical "body" (e.g., robot body, chemical system) rather than relying solely on a separate (typically digital) controller. Components involve a physical system (body/plant) with inherent dynamics (shape, materials, physics) and potentially a simple control unit that influences/selects these dynamics (e.g., by setting parameters, choosing initial states/basins of attraction). The purpose is to achieve more efficient (time, power, memory, cost) computation or control by leveraging the physics, potentially trading off universality and precision for efficiency and robustness. Case studies illustrate applications in robotics (tensairity support system), chemistry (self-assembly of microreactors), and medicine (modeling tumor response).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Morphological Computation/Control Framework, `domain`: Robotics, Chemistry, Medicine, Theoretical Computer Science, `mechanism`: Exploitation of Physical Dynamics (classical/statistical mechanics), Attractor Landscape Manipulation, Self-Assembly, `components`: Physical System (Body/Morphology), Control Unit (optional/simple), Environment, `purpose`: Efficient Computation/Control, Problem Solving, System Modeling.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The core definitions and general principles are explicitly stated (Abstract, Sec 1, Sec 2). The specific components and mechanisms vary depending on the application context (robotics vs. chemistry), which is discussed explicitly in case studies, but the general framework combines these explicitly stated ideas.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper clearly articulates the *concepts* of MC and MCon with illustrative examples (Figs 1, 2) and contrasts them with conventional control. The formal definitions (Sec 2.2), while a step towards clarity, are acknowledged by the authors to be incomplete (e.g., regarding stochasticity, continuity). The case studies provide concrete implementation contexts (Tensairity structure, self-assembling chemtainers, differential equation models), but the implementation details within the case studies vary in depth (e.g., Tensairity setup is clearer than the specific simulation parameters for self-assembly/oncology models which rely heavily on references). The link between the formal definitions and the full complexity of the case studies is sometimes tenuous, as admitted by the authors (Sec 2.2 preamble).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The conceptual clarity is explicit. The clarity of specific implementations in case studies is explicit but varies. The clarity of the *connection* between the formal theory and the complex case studies is explicitly caveated by the authors, making the overall implementation clarity a mix of explicitly clear parts and explicitly acknowledged gaps/limitations.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |

    *   **Note:** Parameters listed are key elements from the formal definition (S, M, j) and specific illustrative examples from the text/case studies. The formal definition parameters define the system abstractly. Case study parameters provide concrete examples but are specific to those instances.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The paper explicitly states that the dynamical systems considered are usually dissipative and take up energy (Sec 2.1). The specific energy source depends on the implementation. Case 1 (Tensairity): Pressurized air. Case 2 (Self-assembly): Chemical potential (implicit in bonding/diffusion), thermal energy (kT). Case 3 (Oncology): Ionizing radiation, heat (hyperthermia). General: Abstract control signals could also be considered an informational input requiring energy indirectly.
    *   Value: N/A (Varies by system context)
    *   Units: N/A (Varies by system context, e.g., Pressure (Pa), Joules (J), Gray (Gy))
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Varied (Pneumatic, Chemical, Thermal, Radiation), `type`: Mechanical, Chemical, Thermal, EM Radiation.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The need for energy input in dissipative systems is explicitly stated. Specific sources are explicit for case studies (Tensairity pressure, radiation dose) or implicit in the physics described (chemical potential, kT for diffusion).

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: Energy is transduced via the physical dynamics of the system. Case 1: Pneumatic pressure energy -> mechanical work (actuation, support), dissipated via material damping/friction. Case 2: Chemical potential energy -> structural organization (self-assembly), kinetic energy (diffusion), dissipated via viscosity/heat. Thermal energy (kT) drives diffusion. Case 3: Radiation energy -> chemical changes (DNA damage, radicals) -> biological response/cell death/repair. Heat energy -> increased molecular motion, protein denaturation, altered reaction rates. General: Control signal energy -> changes in system parameters (e.g., internal tension, valve states) -> altered dynamics. These transformations perform the morphological computation/control.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Pneumatic-Mechanical, Chemical-Structural, Thermal-Kinetic, Radiation-Chemical, ControlSignal-ParameterChange, `from_node`: EnergyInputNode, `to_node`: SystemNode/ComponentNode.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The general idea of using dynamics implies energy transduction (explicit). Specific transduction mechanisms are explicit or implicit based on the physics of the case studies (e.g., pressure causing movement is explicit, chemical potential driving self-assembly is implicit in the description of the process).

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper *claims* MC provides efficiency gains (time, memory, power, space, resources - Sec 1, 2.3, 4) but provides *no quantitative data or metrics* on energy efficiency for any specific MC system or in general. The main argument is avoiding the cost of *encoding/simulating* physics (Sec 2.3). While intuitively plausible, this is not demonstrated quantitatively in terms of energy. Qualitative assessment: Potentially High (compared to simulating the physics), but requires quantification.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute of relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: Efficiency gains are claimed explicitly as a motivation, but the actual energy efficiency is not quantified or demonstrated, making any assessment implicit based on the authors' claims and the underlying idea of leveraging existing physics.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Explicitly mentioned that systems are usually dissipative (Sec 2.1). Mechanisms depend on context: Case 1: Friction, material damping in soft structures. Case 2: Viscous drag during diffusion, heat released during bond formation/breaking (implicit). Case 3: Heat dissipation, entropy increase during biochemical reactions. The formalism (Sec 2.2) doesn't explicitly model dissipation, focusing on state transitions and terminations. Quantification is absent. Qualitative Assessment: Present and significant (as systems are dissipative and often reach attractors/steady states).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode`s (linked to environment) and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s from System components. Attributes: `mechanism`: Friction, Viscosity, HeatLoss, Biochemical Entropy.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The presence of dissipation is explicitly stated. Specific mechanisms are implied by the physics of the systems described (e.g., diffusion implies viscosity). Quantification is absent.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The formal definition of MC (Sec 2.2.1) maps an *initial state* `x` to a *termination* `T` via the functional dynamics `dG`. This describes a system whose future evolution depends only on its *current* state (`S`, `M`, `f`), characteristic of a Markov process, not one with intrinsic memory of past states beyond the current one. While the text discusses systems with history dependence (e.g., Hauser et al. [10] on filters with fading memory, psychological findings on movement organization [35]), the core formalism presented does not incorporate this. Attractors (limit cycles, fixed points) represent stable *future* behaviors determined by the *current* state within a basin, not a memory of the *path* taken to reach that state. The "programmability" allows changing the dynamics (`f_j`), but this is an external change, not an internal memory update based on experience within a single `f_j`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The formal definition (explicit) lacks memory. The surrounding discussion (explicit) mentions concepts related to memory (fading memory filters, psychological memory), but doesn't integrate them into the proposed formalism or demonstrate them robustly in the case studies presented within the paper's own framework. Therefore, based *strictly* on the formalism proposed *in this paper*, memory is absent.

**(Conditional: M3.1 is "No", skip to Module 4.)**

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: Case Study 3.2 explicitly describes the self-assembly of chemtainers into a 2D microreactor based on local linker interactions and diffusion (statistical physics). This is a clear example of spontaneous emergence of spatial order from local rules without external templating of the final structure. The discussion of attractor landscapes (Sec 2.1, Fig 2) also implies self-organization, where stable global patterns of behavior (limit cycles) emerge from the system's internal dynamics (local rules) without the controller dictating the fine details of the trajectory.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Case study 3.2 explicitly details self-assembly. The emergence of behavior from attractor dynamics is explicitly discussed conceptually, and the self-organizing nature is implicit in the definition of attractors arising from local dynamics.

**(Conditional: M4.1 is "Yes", include M4.2-M4.7)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: Case Study 3.2: 1) Diffusion of chemtainers above a substrate. 2) Non-selective, weak binding to the substrate. 3) Reversible, selective binding between adjacent chemtainers based on matching linkers (e.g., DNA hybridization). 4) Release probability depends on the number of bound neighbors (tuned so 6 neighbors make release improbable). 5) Diffusion of monomers/oligomers between chemtainers. 6) Catalysis of specific linker formation/breaking within different chemtainer types. General (Attractors): Abstractly defined by the transition function `f(s, t)` which represents the physics/dynamics governing state evolution from local state `s`. For robots/tensairity, this includes classical mechanics (forces, constraints, material properties like elasticity/friction). For biological examples (skiing, walking), includes biomechanics and neuromuscular control signals modulating parameters like joint stiffness/muscle tension.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Part of the `AdjunctionEdge` description (local side). These define the "LocalInteraction" category of edges. For Case 2: `mechanism`: Diffusion, LinkerBinding (Specific, Reversible), Catalysis. For General: `mechanism`: NewtonianPhysics, Biomechanics, StatisticalPhysics.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: Case study 3.2 rules are explicitly described. For the general attractor discussion, the rules are implicitly represented by the physics appropriate to the system being discussed (classical mechanics for robots, statistical for chemical systems), which is explicitly mentioned but not mathematically detailed in the general discussion.

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------ | :---------- | :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------: | :----------------: | :------------: |
    | Case 3.2 Binding | Linker Specificity | Match/Mismatch | Binary | N/A | Sec 3.2.2 | Explicit | Linker matching described |
    | Case 3.2 Binding | Reversibility/Binding Energy | N/A (Tuned) | N/A | J | Sec 3.2.2 | Explicit | Reversibility and energy tuning mentioned |
    | Case 3.2 Transport | Diffusion Constant (D) | N/A (Implied by kT/Î¶) | > 0 | m^2/s | Sec 2.4, 3.2.2 | Implicit | Diffusion is central, D depends on system specifics |
    | Case 3.2 Catalysis | Reaction Rate Constants | N/A | Varies | 1/s, etc. | Sec 3.2.2 | Implicit | Catalysis implies rate constants, not specified |
    | General Attractors | Material Properties (e.g., Elasticity, Friction) | N/A | Varies | Pa, N/A, etc. | Sec 2, 2.1 | Explicit | Morphology includes material properties |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: Case Study 3.2: A 2D structure of chemtainers with defined neighborhood correlations (spatially heterogeneous but not necessarily crystalline, see Fig 6 right). The functional global order is a reaction environment biased towards specific chemical pathways. General (Attractors): Stable dynamical patterns like limit cycles (oscillatory movements, gaits), fixed points (stable postures). The "attractor landscape" itself (structure of basins and attractors) represents emergent global order.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines a `ConfigurationalNode`. `type`: SelfAssembledStructure (Case 3.2), DynamicalAttractor (General).
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: The self-assembled structure (global order) is explicitly described and shown (Fig 6). Stable dynamical patterns (limit cycles) are explicitly discussed as the goal/result of the dynamics (Fig 2).

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: Case Study 3.2: The resulting structure is stochastic (Fig 6 right shows irregularity) but exhibits "defined neighborhood correlation," suggesting statistical predictability. The *yield* enhancement (Fig 7) demonstrates a predictable functional outcome on average, with relatively low variance ("best result was not far from the average"). General (Attractors): Deterministic systems (formalism assumption, Sec 2.2) lead to predictable attractors given an initial state within a basin. However, the formalism acknowledges issues with continuous systems and stochasticity. Real systems (soft robots, biological systems) are subject to noise and perturbations, reducing predictability. The paper emphasizes robustness *against* small perturbations (self-stabilization) rather than perfect predictability of the exact trajectory. Predictability is high for reaching *some* state within the attractor, lower for the exact state/trajectory.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: Predictability of yield in Case 3.2 is explicitly shown (Fig 7). Predictability in the context of attractors is explicitly discussed (reaching the basin guarantees reaching the attractor), but limitations (noise, stochasticity) impacting fine-grained predictability are also explicitly or implicitly acknowledged. The score reflects this mix.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes to the `AdjunctionEdge` weight.

| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
| CS3.2-Linker | Selective binding between adjacent chemtainers | Binding Specificity | Match/Mismatch | N/A | Explicit | Described as selective via linkers (e.g., DNA) | Sec 3.2.2 |

| General-Dynamics | State evolution based on physics | N/A | N/A | N/A | Explicit | Governed by `f(s,t)` representing system physics | Sec 2.2.1 |

### **4.6. Globally Emergent Order and Order Parameters**
* **Vector ID:** M4.6
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Property ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Protocol | Source |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :------: | :-----: |
| CS3.2-Structure | 2D arrangement of chemtainers | Neighborhood Correlation | N/A (Statistical) | N/A | Explicit | Mentioned as outcome | Computational Simulation | Sec 3.2.2, Fig 6 |

| General-Attractor | Stable dynamic pattern (e.g., Limit Cycle) | Cycle Periodicity, Amplitude | Varies | s, m, rad, etc. | Explicit | Conceptual example | N/A | Sec 2.1, Fig 2 |
| General-Attractor | Stable static pattern (e.g., Fixed Point) | State Vector | Varies | Varies | Explicit | Conceptual example | N/A | Sec 2.2.1 |

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** N/A
    *   **Justification:** The paper does not employ Category Theory concepts like the Yoneda Lemma or embedding to analyze the relationship between local interactions and global emergent order. The formalization uses basic set theory and dynamical systems concepts.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The core concept of the paper *is* embodied computation, termed "Morphological Computation." It's explicitly defined as computation where the physical dynamics of the system itself perform or facilitate the computational task (Abstract, Sec 1, Sec 2). The computation is intrinsic to the material's/body's physical properties and evolution.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The term and concept are central and explicitly defined throughout the paper.

**(Conditional: M5.1 is "Yes", include M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog/Hybrid
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type. `computationClass`: Analog/Hybrid.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *    Justification: The paper emphasizes exploiting continuous physical dynamics (analog aspect, Sec 2.1, 2.3). It also discusses scenarios where a conventional (digital) control unit interacts with the morphological system (Fig 1B, Sec 2.1), suggesting hybrid computation. The formalization (Sec 2.2) attempts to handle continuous state spaces (`S`, `M=R`) but acknowledges difficulties, implicitly supporting an analog view. It explicitly contrasts MC with conventional digital computation.
    *   The term "analogue computation" is used in the keywords.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: The most basic computational operation described by the formalism (Sec 2.2.1) is the mapping of an initial state `x` to a stable termination set `T` (e.g., fixed point, limit cycle) via the system's functional dynamics `dG(x) = T`. This acts as a form of state classification or attractor selection. The paper also mentions more complex computations achievable by post-processing the system state (Sec 2.1, item 3) and cites Hauser et al. [10] demonstrating that compliant bodies coupled with feed-forward networks can approximate time-invariant filters with fading memory, suggesting filtering or function approximation as potential primitives in specific implementations. Case study 3.2 uses self-assembly to implicitly perform quality control and bias reaction pathways, suggesting implicit logic/control primitives.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** Attractor Selection / State Classification; Filtering (via post-processing/specific design); Implicit Logic/Control (in self-assembly).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode`. `primitiveFunction`: AttractorSelection/StateClassification, Filtering, ImplicitLogic.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The `x -> T` mapping is explicit in the formalism. Filtering is explicitly mentioned based on cited work [10]. Implicit logic in self-assembly is an interpretation (implicit) of the described mechanism (explicit bias of reaction pathways).

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
| Unit ID | Description | Processing Power | Energy/Operation | Freq/Resp. Time | Bit-Depth | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
| N/A     | The paper discusses computation at the level of the entire physical system or its dynamics, not discrete computational units with quantifiable power/energy metrics. | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Diffusion Time (t_diam, example) | ~0.4 (for d=1 Î¼m) | s | Sec 2.4 (Eq 2) | Explicit | Example calculation provided. |
        | System Dynamics Evolution | N/A | N/A (depends on system) | Sec 2.2.1 (Monoid M=R) | Explicit | Time is continuous in formalism. |
        | Attractor Convergence Time | N/A | N/A (depends on system/basin) | Sec 2.1, 2.2.1 | Implicit | Reaching termination takes time. |
        | Self-Assembly Time (Case 3.2) | N/A (Sufficiently long) | N/A | Sec 3.2.2 | Implicit | Process run long enough for defined structure. |
        | Response time (Tensairity, Case 3.1) | N/A | N/A | Sec 3.1.2, Fig 4 | Implicit | Feedback control implies response time. |
        | Tumor Response Time (Case 3.3) | N/A | days/weeks | Sec 3.3 | Implicit | Biological processes occur over long timescales. |
    *   **Note:** Specific timescales are generally not quantified except for the diffusion example. The formalism uses continuous time. Case studies imply various timescales relevant to their domains.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not use the terminology or concepts of Active Inference, prediction error minimization, or generative models. While morphological control involves feedback (Fig 1B, Fig 4) and adapting to the environment (e.g., walking, skiing examples), it's framed in terms of dynamical systems, attractors, and parameter tuning, not explicitly as minimizing surprise based on an internal world model. The focus is on exploiting existing physics, not necessarily on building predictive internal models within the MC framework itself (though a coupled conventional controller might do so).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Absence)
        *  Justification: The concepts and terminology of active inference are absent from the text.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper discusses adaptation in several contexts. 1) "Programmability" (Sec 2.2) allows changing the input-output map by varying parameters (e.g., adapting a passive walker to terrain by adjusting spring constants). 2) Reshaping the attractor landscape (Sec 2.1, Fig 2 right) allows the system's behavior patterns to change in response to control signals or environmental changes (e.g., adapting posture for load carrying/skiing). 3) Evolution/Learning: The paper mentions that MC systems are evolvable (Sec 2.3) and uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimize chemtainer properties for yield enhancement in Case Study 3.2 (Fig 7). It also mentions learning in the context of brain control (Sec 2.1) and potential future work combining MC with learning theories (Sec 2.1, Sec 4). These represent changes in system behavior/structure due to experience (evolutionary runs) or parameter adjustments leading to potentially improved performance.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: Programmability and reshaping attractors are explicitly discussed as forms of adaptation/control. Evolution and learning are explicitly mentioned as relevant/possible/future work. Case study 3.2 explicitly uses an evolutionary algorithm for adaptation (optimization).

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "Yes", include M7.2)**

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Mechanisms mentioned or used include:
        1.  **Parameter Tuning:** Externally changing system parameters `j` in the programmable dynamical system `C=(S,M,(f_j)_{jâJ})` to alter the dynamics `f_j` and thus the input-output map `d_{C,j}` (Formalism Sec 2.2.1, Examples in Sec 2.1 like adjusting springs). This is adaptation via external intervention based on desired behavior.
        2.  **Attractor Landscape Reshaping:** Using control signals to modify the system's dynamical structure (e.g., number, shape, location of attractors and basins), effectively changing the available repertoire of stable behaviors (Conceptual Sec 2.1, Fig 2). Mechanism driven by control inputs altering physical parameters (e.g., muscle tension, internal pressure).
        3.  **Evolutionary Algorithm:** Used in Case Study 3.2 (Sec 3.2.2, Fig 7) to optimize chemtainer properties (linkers, functionality) based on simulation outcomes (yield). This involves selection based on performance over generations.
        4.  **Learning (Mentioned):** Mentioned in context of brain control interacting with body dynamics (Sec 2.1) and potential future work (Sec 4), but specific learning algorithms within the MC framework are not detailed, apart from citing work combining compliant bodies with feed-forward neural networks [10, 11] which implies potential for standard ML techniques.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `AdaptationNode` type and `Monad` edges. Specify the type of adaptation mechanism: `ParameterTuning`, `AttractorReshaping`, `EvolutionaryAlgorithm`, `Learning(Mentioned)`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Parameter tuning and attractor reshaping are explicitly described conceptually. Evolutionary algorithm use is explicit in Case Study 3.2. Learning is explicitly mentioned but the mechanisms are mostly implicit or cited.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary behaviors emerging from MC/MCon systems discussed are:
        1.  **Stable Movement/Control Patterns:** Generation of stable gaits (passive walkers), oscillatory movements (general attractors, Fig 2), posture control/support (Tensairity system, Case 3.1), potentially complex trajectories via attractor switching/reshaping (Sec 2.1).
        2.  **Self-Assembly/Structural Organization:** Formation of specific structures (e.g., 2D microreactor network in Case 3.2) from components interacting via local rules.
        3.  **Biased Chemical Synthesis:** Increased yield of a specific target molecule (GS-04) due to the spatially heterogeneous environment created by self-assembly (Case 3.2).
        4.  **Computational Function Mapping:** Implementing a specific input-output function `B: N -> N` via the system dynamics and coding/decoding functions (Formalism Sec 2.2.1). Approximation of filters [10]. Performing logical operations [21].
        5.  **Physiological/Population Dynamics:** Modeling complex biological responses like tumor cell survival fractions under treatment (Case 3.3), characterized by emergent parameters like dose equivalent (G).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`. Specify the type of behavior: `Locomotion/Control`, `SelfAssembly`, `ChemicalSynthesisControl`, `Computation`, `SystemModeling(Biological)`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
       *  Justification: Behaviors like movement patterns, self-assembly, and computation are explicitly discussed. The specific behavior of biased synthesis is explicit in Case 3.2 results. Physiological modeling behavior is explicit in Case 3.3 description.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: Robustness is presented as a key advantage or characteristic. Systems exploiting attractors are inherently robust to small perturbations within the basin of attraction (explicitly stated, Sec 2.1, Sec 2.2). Passive dynamic walkers compensate for small irregularities (explicitly stated, Sec 2.2). Self-assembly with reversible bonds can potentially correct errors (implicit). Case study 3.2 showed robustness in yield optimization (average vs best run, explicitly stated). However, robustness is discussed qualitatively; quantitative metrics (e.g., size of basin, noise tolerance levels, failure rates) are absent. The trade-off might be looser or less precise control (explicitly stated, Sec 2.1, 4). Robustness against larger perturbations or parameter drift is not extensively discussed.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Robustness is explicitly claimed as a feature and conceptually explained via attractors. Case 3.2 provides some explicit evidence for robustness in outcome. Quantitative measures are absent, making the degree of robustness implicit/qualitative.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: This score contributes to the reliability attributes of the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Validation methods depend on the case study. Case 3.1 (Tensairity): Experimental prototype built and tested, measuring joint angle trajectories under load, demonstrating behavior via physical realization and feedback control (Fig 3, 4). Case 3.2 (Self-assembly): In silico simulation using an evolutionary algorithm to optimize parameters and measure yield, validating emergent functional behavior (increased yield, Fig 7) via computational experiments. Case 3.3 (Oncology): Validation via fitting model equations (e.g., G-IR model) to existing experimental data (tumor spheroid survival fractions, Fig 8), demonstrating the model's ability to reproduce observed emergent population dynamics. General Concepts: Validated conceptually through illustrative examples (Fig 1, 2) and by reference to established results in related fields (robotics, dynamical systems, cited work like [10, 21, 23]). Limitations: Robustness claims are mostly qualitative. Scalability of simulated self-assembly to physical realization not shown. Predictive power of oncology models beyond fitting existing data needs further validation.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *   Justification: Validation methods for case studies (experiments, simulations, data fitting) are explicitly described. Conceptual validation is explicit through examples and citations. Limitations are mostly implicit.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper explicitly maps Morphological Computation to Marr's "implementation level," distinguishing it from the "computational level" (Sec 2). It draws analogies between morphological control strategies (attractor switching/reshaping) and biological motor control (walking, skiing, posture adjustment, Sec 2.1). Psychological findings on humans organizing movements into "morphologies" [35] are cited as support (Sec 2.1). The paper interprets the body's contribution to control as "outsourcing of computational tasks to the body" (Sec 1). It contrasts MC efficiency with conventional computation burdens (Sec 2.3). Case study 3.3 uses systems thinking applied to medicine, potentially linking network dynamics to physiological function/dysfunction. The mapping is primarily functional and implementational, comparing MC strategies to biological/cognitive control mechanisms, rather than claiming high-level cognitive states within the morphological system itself.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: If a mapping exists, this defines a `CognitiveMappingEdge`. `source`: BehaviorArchetypeNode (`Locomotion/Control`, `Computation`), `target`: CognitiveFunctionNode (`MotorControl`, `Computation`, `ProblemSolving`). `mappingType`: Analogy/ImplementationLevel.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The mapping to Marr's level, analogies to biological motor control, comparisons to conventional computation, and interpretation of outsourcing computation are all explicitly stated in the text.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification: Based on the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:
        *   Level 0-1 (Non-Cognitive/Simple Responsivity): Exceeded, as systems involve dynamics, computation, and control loops.
        *   Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity): Partially met. Systems show basic adaptation (parameter tuning, attractor reshaping, evolutionary optimization in simulations) and computation intrinsic to their 'body'.
        *   Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy): Met. The concept involves adapting behavior based on simple control signals or environmental interaction (e.g., switching attractors, optimizing yield). The behavioral repertoire might be limited by the designed morphology/dynamics. There's feedback involved (Fig 1B, Fig 4).
        *   Level 4+ (Goal-Directed/Model-Based, etc.): Not demonstrated. While the *overall system* (including a potential external controller or human) might be goal-directed, the paper doesn't provide evidence for the *morphological component itself* having internal models, planning capabilities, or higher cognitive functions described in Levels 4-10. The formalism focuses on reactive dynamics based on the current state.
        *   The score of 3 reflects the demonstrated adaptive and computational capabilities intrinsic to the physical system, aligning with reactive/adaptive autonomy, but without evidence for internal models or higher cognition within the morphological computation itself as defined/demonstrated here.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The system's capabilities (computation, adaptation via attractors/evolution) are explicitly described or demonstrated in case studies. The score is an interpretation based on comparing these capabilities to the explicit definitions in the Cognizance Scale. The lack of evidence for higher levels (internal models etc.) is explicit in its absence from the paper's descriptions and formalism.

    | Model-Based Reasoning              |      0       | No evidence of internal models being used for reasoning/prediction within MC.      | N/A                                | Explicit (Absence) | Topic not covered/formalism reactive. |
    | **Overall score**                 |    ~1.25       | Low cognitive function demonstrated directly by the morphological computation aspect itself. | N/A                                | N/A                 | N/A |

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not discuss the concept of criticality, phase transitions (except in passing regarding potential simulation difficulty, Sec 2.3), scale-free behavior, power laws, or long-range correlations in the context of morphological computation or control systems.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper provides a valuable conceptual and formal step towards understanding Morphological Computation (MC) and Control (MCon), positioning it as computation embodied in physical dynamics. Its key strengths lie in explicitly defining MC, contrasting it with conventional computation, highlighting potential efficiency gains by leveraging physics, and demonstrating its relevance across diverse domains (robotics, chemistry, medicine) via case studies. The concept of exploiting attractor landscapes for robust control and the use of self-assembly showcase emergent order and computation. However, significant limitations exist from a CT-GIN perspective. The formalism, while novel, is acknowledged as incomplete, particularly regarding stochasticity and continuous systems, and lacks intrinsic mechanisms for memory or complex adaptation. Quantitative metrics are largely absent, especially for energy efficiency, computational performance (speed, power), memory characteristics, and robustness, making the claimed advantages difficult to assess rigorously. While adaptation is discussed and demonstrated via external tuning or simulation (evolution), intrinsic learning mechanisms within the MC framework are not developed. Cognitive mappings are analogical, and the demonstrated capabilities align with reactive/adaptive autonomy (Level 3) rather than higher cognitive functions. Overall, the paper lays important groundwork but requires significant further development in formal rigor and quantitative experimental/simulation validation to fully realize its potential within the CT-GIN framework for cognizant matter.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   Extend the formal definition of MC to adequately handle stochastic processes and continuous state spaces, addressing the acknowledged limitations.
        *   Incorporate mechanisms for intrinsic memory (history dependence beyond current state) into the MC formalism and explore physical realizations.
        *   Develop and implement quantitative metrics to measure energy efficiency, computational performance (speed, power, error rates), memory fidelity (retention, capacity), and robustness for specific MC systems.
        *   Investigate and implement intrinsic adaptation and learning mechanisms within MC systems, moving beyond external parameter tuning or simulated evolution.
        *   Explore the potential for MC systems to implement more complex computational primitives beyond attractor selection, such as model-based reasoning or prediction, potentially bridging towards active inference.
        *   Apply Category Theory more deeply to analyze the relationship between local rules and emergent global behavior/computation in MC systems (e.g., via Yoneda embedding).
        *   Conduct more rigorous experimental validation of MC principles, particularly focusing on quantitative performance assessment and robustness analysis under various conditions.
        *   Investigate the scalability of designing and fabricating complex MC systems, especially those involving self-organization or intricate dynamic control.

## M14: CT-GIN Knowledge Graph

*   **Vector ID:** M14
*   **Vector Type:** Visualization

### **14.1. CT-GIN Knowledge Graph:**
* **Content:**
A schematic diagram would show a central `SystemNode` representing Morphological Computation/Control. This node would have attributes like `systemType: MC/MCon`, `domain: Robotics/Chemistry/Medicine`, `mechanism: PhysicalDynamics/SelfAssembly`.
*   **Energy:** An `EnergyInputNode` (attributes: `source: Pneumatic/Chemical/...`) connects via an `EnergyTransductionEdge` (`mechanism: PhysicsBased`) to the `SystemNode`. `EnergyDissipationNode`s connect from the `SystemNode` (`mechanism: Friction/Heat/...`). Efficiency attributes on edges would be marked as N/A/Low.
*   **Memory:** No dedicated `MemoryNode` based on the formalism. A potential link could exist from `SystemNode` state back to its future dynamics, but this isn't explicitly modeled as memory *storage*. Citations related to fading memory could be linked externally.
*   **Self-Organization:** For Case 3.2, `ComponentNode`s (Chemtainers) interact via `AdjunctionEdge`s (`rules: LinkerBinding/Diffusion`) leading to a `ConfigurationalNode` (`type: SelfAssembledStructure`). For General MC, `SystemNode` dynamics lead to `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s (`type: Locomotion/Attractor`) representing emergent dynamic order. `AdjunctionEdge`s would represent the system's transition function `f`. Predictability scores would be attributes.
*   **Computation:** The `SystemNode` itself or a dedicated `ComputationNode` (`computationClass: Analog/Hybrid`) embodies computation. Its function attribute is `primitiveFunction: AttractorSelection/StateClassification`. Links exist from Input State Nodes to Termination (Attractor) Nodes via the computation process.
*   **Temporal Dynamics:** `TemporalNode`s indicate relevant timescales (e.g., `t_diffusion`, `t_convergence`), linked to relevant processes/nodes. Adaptation nodes link across time.
*   **Adaptation:** An `AdaptationNode` (`mechanism: ParameterTuning/EvolutionaryAlgorithm/...`) modifies the `SystemNode` or its `AdjunctionEdge`s (dynamics `f_j`).
*   **Behavior:** `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s (`type: Locomotion/SelfAssembly/...`) emerge from the `SystemNode` dynamics/organization. `ReliabilityAttribute` (robustness score) is associated.
*   **Cognitive Proximity:** `CognitiveMappingEdge`s (`type: Analogy/ImplementationLevel`) link `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s to abstract `CognitiveFunctionNode`s (`MotorControl`, `Computation`). The overall system gets a `CognitiveProximityScore` attribute.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:** The template could benefit from a more nuanced way to capture systems that are *hybrids* of theoretical concepts and experimental/computational case studies. Currently, classifying as "Hybrid" skips M11/M12, but perhaps a dedicated "Hybrid Assessment" module capturing the quality of the theory-experiment link would be useful. A probe for "Scalability" (both computational and physical realization) could be added, as it's often discussed but not explicitly captured.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:** The definition of "Memory" (M3.1) as "persists beyond stimulus, influencing future behavior" is good, but applying it rigorously can be tricky for systems where the "state" *is* the memory (like attractor position). Clarifying if intrinsic history dependence (beyond Markovian state) is required would help. The distinction between "Emergent Behavior" (M8) and "Global Order" (M4.3) could be slightly refined â M4.3 seems focused on structure/pattern, M8 on function?
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:** Guidance is generally good, but examples could be more consistent (e.g., specifying node *types* vs. node *instances*). Providing a standard mini-ontology or graphical legend for node/edge types within the template instructions might improve consistency. Mapping adaptation mechanisms (M7.2) to CT `Monad` edges could be elaborated.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:** Scoring "Energy Efficiency" (M2.3) and "Dissipation" (M2.4) was impossible due to lack of data; the template should perhaps allow "N/A - Data Absent" instead of forcing a score based on qualitative assessment or defaulting to 0. Calculating the CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) was ambiguous regarding which scores to include (presence flags vs. 0-10 scores, handling N/A). Explicit calculation rules (e.g., "Average all 0-10 scores in M1-M10, treating N/A as 0, treating Binary Yes as 10, No as 0") are needed. The Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on the interpretation of the scale, which is subjective. More concrete examples for each level linked to material system features would help calibration.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:** Mapping the paper's content, which blends formal theory with disparate case studies, onto a single system assessment was challenging. The template assumes a single, well-defined system, making it harder for conceptual/framework papers. Perhaps allow sub-sections for different case studies within relevant modules.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is extremely detailed and structured, which is good for consistency but makes it lengthy to apply. The conditional logic (skipping sections) is helpful. Strict formatting is demanding but ensures parsability. Adding a glossary of key terms (Embodied Computation, Self-Organization, Active Inference, Criticality, etc.) as defined within the CT-GIN context could be beneficial.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        * Add explicit calculation rules for M13.1 score.
        * Add "N/A - Data Absent" option for scores where quantification is expected but missing.
        * Clarify distinction between M4.3 and M8.1 if needed.
        * Add optional sub-sections within modules for analyzing multiple case studies or distinct system aspects presented in one paper.
        * Provide a concise CT-GIN term glossary.
        * Consider a dedicated module for Hybrid papers assessing theory-practice linkage.
