**Paper Type:** Hybrid

## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system consists of conical microfluidic channels connecting two bulk reservoirs of an aqueous 1:1 electrolyte. An external voltage V(t) is applied across the channel. The conductance of these channels depends on the history of the applied voltage due to transient concentration polarization, making them function as memristors. The paper primarily models the physics of a single conical channel (using Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations and an analytical approximation) and then proposes an iontronic circuit composed of three such oriented conical channels, batteries, and a capacitor, designed to mimic the Hodgkin-Huxley model of neuronal signaling. The purpose is to demonstrate that these conical memristors can be used as building blocks for neuromorphic circuits capable of generating neuronal features like action potentials and spike trains. Key components are the conical channel, aqueous electrolyte (water + ions), electrodes (implicit for applying V(t)), and, in the proposed circuit, additional cones, batteries, and a capacitor.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Hybrid (Material + Circuit), `domain`: Microfluidics/Iontronics/Neuromorphics, `mechanism`: Concentration Polarization/Ionic Transport/Memristance, `components`: Conical Channel, Electrolyte, Electrodes, (Proposed: Batteries, Capacitor), `purpose`: Neuromorphic Signaling Simulation/Memristor Characterization
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the conical channel system, the governing equations, the memristive behavior, the proposed circuit components, and the goal of mimicking neuronal signaling (Abstract, Introduction, Fig.1, Fig.3b).

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The description of the single conical channel system, including geometry, materials, governing equations (PNPS), and boundary conditions, is very clear and detailed (Fig. 1, equations 1-4, text). The analytical approximation (AA) derivation (Eqs. 5-8) is explained, though some details are in the SM. The proposed circuit (Fig. 3b, Eq. 9) is clearly depicted and its governing equation is provided. Parameter values for the standard case are given. Clarity could be slightly improved with more detail on the FEA setup within the main text, but overall, it's well-described for reproduction/verification.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The parameters, equations, and schematics are explicitly provided in the text and figures.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Channel Length (L) | 10 | µm | Text p.2 | Explicit | High | N/A |

    *   **Note:** These parameters define the physical structure and transport properties of the single conical channel used in the core analysis. Data reliability is 'High' as these are stated parameters for the model/simulations, 'Medium' for τ as it's derived.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy source is the externally applied electrical potential difference, V(t), across the conical channel (or the circuit). In the proposed circuit, batteries (E+, E-, Es) also provide potential differences.
    *   Value: Variable (e.g., ±1 V for single cone analysis, E values for circuit)
    *   Units: V (Volts)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: External Voltage Supply/Batteries, `type`: Electrical Potential
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The application of V(t) is explicitly stated as the driving force for ion transport and current (Abstract, Fig. 1 text, Eq. 8). Batteries are explicitly shown in the circuit diagram (Fig. 3b) and mentioned in the text (p.4).

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: Electrical potential energy from V(t) drives ion movement (conduction, diffusion, advection - Nernst-Planck Eq. 3) and fluid flow (electro-osmosis - Stokes Eq. 4). This kinetic energy of ions and fluid is dissipated through viscous drag within the fluid and interactions with channel walls. Electrical energy is also converted into stored potential energy associated with non-equilibrium ion concentration gradients (concentration polarization). In the circuit, chemical energy from batteries is converted to electrical potential energy. Energy is stored in the capacitor's electric field.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Electromigration/Diffusion/Advection/Electroosmosis/Concentration Polarization/Capacitive Storage, `from_node`: `EnergyInputNode` (Electrical Potential), `to_node`: `KineticEnergyNode` (Ions/Fluid), `PotentialEnergyNode` (Concentration Gradient/Capacitor)
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The driving potential (V(t)) and resulting ion transport mechanisms (diffusion, conduction, advection) and fluid flow are explicit (Eqs. 3, 4). Concentration polarization is explicit. Energy dissipation (viscous, resistive) and storage (concentration gradients, capacitor) are implied by the physical processes described but not explicitly framed as energy transduction steps.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not discuss energy efficiency. The primary function described (memristance, neuromorphic signaling) relies on dissipative processes (ion transport through a resistive medium, viscous fluid flow). While energy is temporarily stored in concentration gradients and the capacitor, the overall operation appears highly dissipative, analogous to ionic currents in biological neurons which are not optimized for energy efficiency in the traditional work-output sense. No metrics for efficiency are provided. The score reflects the lack of focus on efficiency and the inherently dissipative nature of the underlying ion transport processes.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute of relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: Efficiency is not mentioned. The dissipative nature is inferred from the physics (ionic current through electrolyte, viscous flow).

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Energy dissipation occurs primarily through:
        1.  Joule heating: Due to ionic current (I) flowing through the electrolyte resistance (related to conductance g). (Qualitative: Significant, as current flow is central).
        2.  Viscous dissipation: Due to electro-osmotic fluid flow (u) within the channel, governed by fluid viscosity (η). (Qualitative: Present, mentioned as Stokesian advection and electro-osmotic flow Q(V), but likely less dominant than Joule heating unless flow is very strong).
        Dissipation is not explicitly quantified in the paper.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode`s (Joule Heating, Viscous Loss) and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s from `KineticEnergyNode`(Ions/Fluid) to `EnergyDissipationNode`s.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Current flow (I) and conductance (g) are explicit, implying Joule heating (I²R or gV²). Fluid flow (u) and viscosity (η) are explicit, implying viscous dissipation. However, the dissipation mechanisms themselves are not explicitly discussed or quantified.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly states that the channels "have a memory" (Abstract) because their conductance depends on the history of the applied voltage. This is identified as a memristive effect ("hence they are memristors", p.1; Eq. 7 shows conductance depends on the time trace of V(t)). The memory arises from transient concentration polarization, where the ion distribution within the channel changes relatively slowly (diffusive timescale τ) in response to voltage changes, thus influencing future conductance for a given voltage.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The terms "memory" and "memristor" are used explicitly, and the mechanism (history-dependent conductance via concentration polarization) is described.

**(Conditional: If M3.1 is "No", skip to Module 4. If "Yes", include M3.2 and M3.3.)**

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 4
*   Justification: The memory is volatile, analog, and based on the physical state (ion concentration profile). The state (conductance g[V(t), t]) continuously evolves based on the history of the input voltage V(t) towards a steady state g∞[V(t)], governed by Eq. 7. It's not based on discrete, stable states. Retention is relatively short-term (ms scale, τ). Capacity is limited - it stores an integrated history of recent voltage affecting the current conductance, not distinct past events. Read-out (measuring current for a given voltage) reflects the current conductance state. It resembles short-term physical memory rather than high-fidelity, multi-state digital memory. The score reflects its analog, volatile nature and limited capacity/retention set by the diffusion time.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type. Attributes: `mechanism`: Concentration Polarization, `type`: Analog, Volatile, Physical State (Ion Distribution)
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The memristive nature and dependence on V(t) history (Eq. 7) are explicit. The analog, volatile characteristics and the physical basis (ion concentration) are explicitly described or directly inferable from the model and timescale τ. The scoring requires interpretation based on the definitions.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: τ ≈ L² / (12D) ≈ 4.8 (for standard parameters)
*    Units: ms (milliseconds)
*   Justification: The paper derives and explicitly states the characteristic timescale τ for the relaxation of the conductance (memory retention) is governed by ionic diffusion across the channel length L (Eq. 6, p.3). For the standard parameters (L=10 µm, D=1.75 µm²/ms), τ is calculated to be 4.8 ms. Fig 2a shows the time lag is ~τ. The right-hand inset of Fig 2c confirms the L² dependence.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: Formula for τ (Eq. 6) and its calculated value (4.8 ms) are explicitly given. The physical meaning as the memory timescale is explicitly discussed.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute (`retention_time`) of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: N/A (Analog)
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: The memory state (conductance) is described as a continuous variable evolving according to a differential equation (Eq. 7). It doesn't have discrete, countable states. Therefore, quantifying capacity in terms of distinct states or traditional bits is not directly applicable. It stores a single analog value representing the recent integrated voltage history's effect on ion distribution.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The analog nature is implied by the continuous differential equation (Eq. 7) describing the conductance state. The lack of discrete states means standard capacity metrics don't apply.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: Readout accuracy is not discussed. In the context of the model, the readout (current I = gV) is deterministic based on the calculated conductance g. In a physical system, noise (thermal, shot noise, fabrication variations) would affect accuracy, but this is not analyzed.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
       *  Justification: The concept of readout accuracy is not addressed in the paper.

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: Governed by 1/τ
    *   Units: s⁻¹
    *   Justification: The memory is volatile and decays exponentially towards the steady-state conductance g∞[V(t)] with timescale τ (Eq. 7). The "degradation rate" in the absence of a sustaining voltage difference would correspond to the rate of relaxation back to equilibrium, characterized by 1/τ. For standard parameters, this is 1/4.8 ms⁻¹ ≈ 208 s⁻¹.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
            * Justification: The exponential relaxation with timescale τ is explicit in Eq. 7. Identifying 1/τ as the degradation/relaxation rate constant is a standard interpretation of such dynamics.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute (`decay_rate`) of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Write/Update (g) | N/A | V(t) * I[V(t),t] | W | N/A | Eq. 8 | Implicit | Energy cost not framed per bit (analog memory); Power is voltage*current. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: Energy cost related to memory operations (changing the conductance state) is not explicitly calculated or discussed. The power consumed during operation is implicitly given by V*I (per Eq. 8), which is associated with driving the state change, but not broken down per "bit" or specific memory operation.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | N/A       | N/A         | N/A    | N/A   | N/A             | N/A          | N/A             | Memory fidelity and robustness metrics are not discussed or quantified in the paper. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
*   Justification: The paper does not address memory fidelity or robustness metrics.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system involves prefabricated conical channels. While the ion distribution (concentration profile) within the channel changes dynamically (concentration polarization) due to local interactions (diffusion, migration, advection driven by the applied field and boundary conditions), this does not constitute self-organization in the sense of spontaneous emergence of new global *structural* order or patterns from initially disordered components without external templating. The channel geometry is fixed, and the ion profile is a *response* to the applied field within that fixed structure. The proposed circuit's behavior (APs, spike trains) emerges from the *designed interaction* of components (cones, batteries, capacitor), not spontaneous structural organization.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The system description makes it clear the structure is fabricated (Fig 1, parameters L, Rb, Rt). The dynamics described (PNPS) are responses within this fixed structure. The definition of self-organization requires distinguishing this from designed structures and responses within them.

**(Conditional: If M4.1 is "No", skip to Module 5. If "Yes", include M4.2-M4.7)**

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper demonstrates that the conical channel itself performs a computation in the sense that its physical state (ion distribution, resulting in conductance g) dynamically integrates the history of the input voltage V(t) according to Eq. 7. This history-dependent conductance determines the output current I = gV (Eq. 8). This integration and state-dependent output is intrinsic to the material system's physics (ion transport in the cone), not imposed by an external digital controller. The proposed circuit further leverages this embodied property for neuromorphic computation (generating APs).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The memristive behavior (history-dependent conductance) intrinsic to the channel's physics is explicitly shown (Eq. 7, Fig. 2). Framing this explicitly as "embodied computation" is an interpretation based on the definition, but strongly supported by the paper's focus on using this physical effect for neuromorphic functions.

**(Conditional: If M5.1 is "No", skip to Module 6. If "Yes", include M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog/Neuromorphic
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type. Attributes: `computation_type`: Analog, Neuromorphic
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *    Justification: The conductance 'g' evolves continuously according to a differential equation (Eq. 7), indicating analog computation. The application focus is explicitly neuromorphic, aiming to mimic neuronal behavior (Abstract, Introduction, Fig. 3).

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Temporal Integration / State-dependent Resistance (Memristance). The basic operation performed by the material (cone+electrolyte) is the dynamic, leaky integration of the applied voltage history into its conductance state 'g', governed by dg/dt = (g∞[V(t)] - g)/τ. This state 'g' then acts as a variable resistor determining the output current I = gV.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** Leaky Integration
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode`. Attribute: `primitive_function`: Leaky Integration / Memristance
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The governing equation (Eq. 7) explicitly describes a leaky integration process for the conductance 'g'. Identifying this as the computational primitive is an interpretation based on the mathematical form and its role in determining the output (Eq. 8). The term "memristor" is explicit.

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Unit ID | Description | Processing Power | Energy/Operation | Freq/Resp. Time | Bit-Depth | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
| ConeMem | Single Conical Memristor | N/A | N/A (Power = VI) | ~1/τ ≈ 200 Hz | Analog | Eq. 7, Eq. 8 | Implicit | Processing power/energy per operation not defined. Frequency related to τ. Analog nature implies continuous bit-depth. |

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Conductance Relaxation / Memory (τ) | 4.8 (std), varies with L² | ms | Eq. 6, p.3 | Explicit | Characteristic time derived and discussed. |
        | Input Voltage Frequency (f) | 40 (Fig 2), variable | Hz | Fig 2 | Explicit | Frequency used in example simulation. |
        | AP Duration (Circuit) | ~10-20 | ms | Fig 3d | Explicit | Estimated from plot. |
        | Spike Train Period (Circuit) | ~80-100 | ms | Fig 3f | Explicit | Estimated from plot (tunable). |
        | Fast Channel τ (Circuit) | 0.048 | ms | p.4 (derived from L=1µm) | Explicit | Calculated using Eq. 6 for circuit parameters. |
        | Slow Channel τ (Circuit) | 30 | ms | p.4 (derived from L=25µm) | Explicit | Calculated using Eq. 6 for circuit parameters. |
    *   **Note:** Multiple timescales are relevant: the intrinsic memory time τ of a single cone, the frequency of applied signals, and the emergent timescales of the proposed circuit (AP duration, spike period). Circuit channel timescales are also specified.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system dynamics (single cone or proposed circuit) are described by deterministic physics-based equations (PNPS, AA model, circuit equations). There is no evidence of an internal predictive model, minimization of prediction error, or active action selection based on such a model as required by Active Inference. The behavior, while complex and history-dependent, is reactive based on the immediate input and the integrated past state according to fixed physical laws.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper describes the system using standard physics/circuit models (PNPS, Kirchhoff's laws, HH analogy). These models do not incorporate the elements of active inference (prediction error minimization, internal models). The absence is inferred based on the provided description.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system exhibits memory (conductance depends on past voltage), but this is a dynamic response governed by fixed physical parameters (diffusion coefficient, geometry). The underlying rules (Eq. 7) and parameters (τ, g∞) do not change based on experience or lead to improved performance over time in the sense of adaptive plasticity or learning. The memristive effect itself is history-dependent but not adaptive; the system always responds according to the same fixed physical laws. The circuit's behavior is also determined by fixed component parameters.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The model presented (Eqs. 5-9) uses fixed parameters. There is no mention of parameters changing over time due to history beyond the dynamic change in conductance 'g' itself. The absence of adaptation is inferred.

**(Conditional: If M7.1 is "No", skip to Module 8. If "Yes", include M7.2)**

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content:
        1.  **Single Cone:** Exhibits memristance (history-dependent conductance/resistance), specifically showing hysteresis in conductance-voltage and current-voltage plots (pinched hysteresis loop). This behavior stems from dynamic concentration polarization.
        2.  **Proposed Circuit:** Exhibits key features of neuronal signaling:
            *   All-or-none action potential (AP) generation in response to a supercritical current pulse stimulus.
            *   Generation of a spike train (sequence of APs) in response to a sustained supercritical stimulus current.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode`. Types: "Memristance", "Hysteresis", "Action Potential Generation", "Spike Train Generation".
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: Memristance, hysteresis loops, action potentials, and spike trains are all explicitly described and shown in figures (Abstract, p.1, Fig 2, Fig 3).

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 5
    *   Justification: The paper focuses on demonstrating the *existence* of the behaviors (memristance, APs, spike trains) under ideal simulation conditions (AA and FEA models, numerical circuit solution). Robustness to noise, parameter variations (e.g., fabrication tolerances in cone geometry, temperature fluctuations, electrolyte concentration changes), or component failures is not investigated. The agreement between AA and FEA (Fig 2) suggests the core memristive behavior is robust within the model assumptions. The HH circuit model is known to be relatively robust, but its implementation with these specific iontronic components is not tested for robustness. The score reflects the demonstrated behavior in simulation but the lack of analysis regarding perturbations.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Robustness is not explicitly discussed or tested. The score is an assessment based on the type of study (simulations of idealized models) and general knowledge of HH circuits, lacking specific evidence from the paper.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: This score contributes to the reliability attributes of the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content:
        *   **Memristance/Hysteresis (Single Cone):** Validated through (1) Finite Element (FE) numerical simulations of the full PNPS equations (1-4) and (2) an Approximate Analytical (AA) model (Eqs. 5-8). The agreement between FE and AA results (shown in Fig. 2a, b, c) provides validation for the AA model and confirms the hysteretic behavior arising from concentration polarization dynamics. The pinched hysteresis loop (Fig. 2c) is presented as the hallmark validation. Comparison to experimental results in *similar* systems is mentioned qualitatively (p.3).
        *   **APs/Spike Trains (Circuit):** Validated through numerical solution of the proposed circuit equations (Eq. 9 coupled with Eq. 7 for each cone), using the validated AA model for cone conductance. The emergence of all-or-none APs (Fig. 3d, inset) and spike trains (Fig. 3f) is demonstrated through these simulations when specific stimulus protocols (Fig. 3c, e) are applied.
        *   **Limitations:** Validation is purely theoretical/computational. No experimental validation of *this specific system* or circuit is presented. Robustness/reproducibility under non-ideal conditions is not assessed.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The validation methods (FEA, AA, circuit simulation) and results (agreement between methods, generation of target behaviors in simulations) are explicitly described and shown in figures/text (Sec starting "To verify the AA...", Fig 2 legend, Sec starting "Having derived...", Fig 3 legend).

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, the paper explicitly maps the system's functionality to cognitive/neuronal processes.
        1.  **Single Cone Memristor:** Analogized to ion channels responsible for electric signaling within neurons (p.1) and synapses connecting neurons (p.1), due to its memristive properties.
        2.  **Proposed Circuit:** Explicitly designed as an iontronic analog of the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) circuit model for neuronal action potentials (p.4, Fig 3a vs 3b). The different conical channels are explicitly intended to take on the roles of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels (p.4). The resulting circuit behavior (APs, spike trains) is directly compared to neuronal communication features (Abstract, p.1, p.4, p.5).
        Limitations: The mapping is analogical. It demonstrates that similar dynamics can be achieved using iontronic components, but does not claim the components themselves possess cognitive functions beyond this analogy.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge`. Source: `BehaviorArchetypeNode` ("Action Potential Generation", "Spike Train Generation", "Memristance"), Target: `CognitiveFunctionNode` ("Neuronal Signaling", "Synaptic Plasticity (analogy)", "Ion Channel Function (analogy)").
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The analogies to neurons, synapses, ion channels, the HH model, APs, and spike trains are explicitly stated throughout the paper (Abstract, Introduction, Results/Discussion related to Fig. 3).

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates Level 1 (Simple Responsivity - ionic current response to voltage) and utilizes Level 2 behavior (Sub-Organismal Responsivity - memristance as a basic form of plasticity/history dependence) to *simulate* higher-level phenomena (neuronal signaling). The emergent circuit behavior (APs, spike trains) mimics aspects of biological neuronal function (relevant to Levels 3-4), but this behavior arises from the *designed circuit architecture* using components with Level 2 properties, not from intrinsic cognitive capabilities of the material itself reaching Levels 3 or 4. The system doesn't exhibit goal-directedness, internal models, learning beyond the fixed memristive dynamics, or other higher cognitive functions defined in the scale. The score reflects the successful demonstration of complex dynamics analogous to biology, built upon relatively simple physical memory effects, but lacking genuine higher cognitive attributes within the components or the circuit itself.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is based on interpreting the system's demonstrated capabilities (memristance, circuit dynamics) against the provided CT-GIN Cognizance Scale definitions. This requires judgment based on the evidence presented (explicit behaviors) and the definitions (explicit scale).

**CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:** (Provided for reference during scoring)

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear
    *   Justification: The paper does not explicitly discuss or test for criticality (scale-free behavior, power laws, long-range correlations). While Hodgkin-Huxley type systems can exhibit dynamics potentially near bifurcation points (e.g., threshold for firing), and concentration polarization involves non-linear coupled equations, there is no analysis provided to determine if the system operates near a critical point in the statistical physics sense.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *    Justification: The concept of criticality is not mentioned or investigated in the paper.

N/A

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

**(Paper type is Hybrid, primarily theoretical/computational but motivated by experimental observations. Treating theory aspects here.)**

*   **Vector ID:** M12
*   **Vector Type:** Theory

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework is based on established physics (PNPS equations). Assumptions for the analytical approximation (AA model, Eq. 5-7, e.g., single exponential relaxation) are stated, and the model is compared against numerical solutions (FEA) of the full equations, showing good agreement (Fig. 2). The circuit model (Eq. 9) uses standard Kirchhoff's laws. The mathematical descriptions appear sound and internally consistent within the stated approximations. Rigor could be enhanced by more discussion on the limits of the AA model (mentioned briefly in SM ref [89]).
       * Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
       *  Justification: The equations and models are explicit. The assessment of rigor involves evaluating their consistency and validity based on the presented evidence (comparison to FEA) and general physical principles.

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper argues that the proposed neuromorphic circuit is "within experimental reach" (p.2) because conical pores are "comparatively easy to fabricate" (p.1, citing refs [39-42]) and the circuit uses standard components (capacitor, batteries). The dimensions and material parameters used are based on realistic values (e.g., PMMA properties, electrolyte concentrations). Challenges exist in precisely fabricating multiple matched cones, integrating them with stable electrodes and batteries at the micro/nanoscale, and managing potential issues like electrode reactions or channel clogging, but the fundamental components are experimentally accessible. The score reflects the plausibility balanced against integration challenges.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The paper explicitly claims experimental reachability and cites fabrication references. Assessing the actual feasibility involves considering practical challenges not fully detailed in the paper, hence partially implicit.

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: If realized, the system provides a physical instantiation of memristive memory based on ion concentration dynamics and a platform for building HH-like circuits. This aligns with CT-GIN principles related to embodied computation, memory, and emergent behavior (in the circuit). The model offers tunable timescales (via L) which is desirable. Its potential impact lies in demonstrating neuromorphic functions using iontronics, bridging biological and artificial systems. However, as analyzed, it lacks intrinsic adaptation/learning and higher cognitive features. Its contribution to CT-GIN would be primarily as a well-characterized building block exhibiting physical memory and enabling circuit-level emergent dynamics.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: This score assesses the *potential* impact based on the theoretical description and its alignment with CT-GIN goals, requiring interpretation and judgment beyond explicit statements.

## M13: Overall Assessment & Scoring

### **13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score:**

Re-calculating based on *all* available scores: M1.2(8), M2.3(1), M3.2(4), M4.4(N/A->0), M5.1(Yes->implicit computation score needed, let's estimate 5 based on primitive nature), M8.2(5), M9.2(2), M12.1(8), M12.2(7), M12.3(6). If using only M1-M4, M8.2, M9.2 where M4.1=No skips M4.2-M4.7: Avg(M1.2=8, M2.3=1, M3.2=4, M8.2=5, M9.2=2) = (8+1+4+5+2)/5 = 20/5 = 4.0. Let's use the average of numeric scores from M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M5.4(implicit frequency ~200Hz -> maybe score 2 based on speed?), M8.2, M9.2. (8+1+4+2+5+2)/6 = 22/6 = 3.67. Let's stick to the simpler first calculation Avg(M1.2=8, M2.3=1, M3.2=4, M4.1=No->0, M8.2=5, M9.2=2) = (8+1+4+0+5+2)/6 = 20/6 ≈ 3.33.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a hybrid theoretical and computational study of iontronic memristors based on conical microfluidic channels, demonstrating their potential for neuromorphic computing. Key strengths from a CT-GIN perspective include the clear physical mechanism for embodied analog memory (memristance via concentration polarization) characterized by a tunable diffusive timescale (τ), and the demonstration of emergent circuit behavior (action potentials, spike trains) mimicking neuronal function using these components. The theoretical model (AA) shows good agreement with more detailed simulations (FEA). However, CT-GIN limitations are significant. The system lacks structural self-organization and adaptive plasticity/learning; the memory is volatile and low-capacity. Energy efficiency and robustness are not assessed. While successfully mimicking specific neuronal dynamics (Cognitive Level 2 achieved, Level 3/4 simulated via circuit design), the system does not exhibit higher intrinsic cognitive functions. Overall, the conical memristor serves as a well-characterized building block displaying physical memory, suitable for constructing designed circuits with complex dynamics, but represents an early stage in realizing true material intelligence or cognizance according to the CT-GIN framework.

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Experimental Validation:** Fabricate and characterize the proposed HH circuit to confirm simulation predictions and assess real-world performance, robustness, and noise sensitivity.
        *   **Introduce Adaptivity:** Explore modifications to the cone material or surface chemistry that could introduce activity or allow conductance parameters (e.g., τ, g∞ relationship) to adapt based on history, implementing a form of learning.
        *   **Energy Analysis:** Quantify energy consumption and dissipation mechanisms (Joule heating, viscous losses) for both single cones and the circuit. Evaluate energy efficiency for specific computational tasks (e.g., per spike).
        *   **Explore Complex Computations:** Investigate if networks of these iontronic memristors (beyond the simple HH circuit) can perform more complex computations, potentially leveraging their analog nature for tasks like reservoir computing.
        *   **Long-Term Memory:** Research alternative iontronic mechanisms or material combinations capable of longer-term, potentially non-volatile memory storage beyond simple concentration polarization.
        *   **Robustness Studies:** Perform simulations and experiments to characterize the system's robustness to variations in fabrication, temperature, ionic strength, and electrical noise.
        *   **Integrate Sensing:** Explore possibilities for the cones to sense local chemical environments, coupling sensing directly to the memristive state for integrated sense-compute functions.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically for *tunability* of parameters (like memory timescale τ via L in this paper) could be useful under M1 or the relevant module (e.g., M3 for memory).
        *   A probe distinguishing behavior of the *core component* vs. behavior of a *circuit/network* built from it might clarify analysis, especially for hybrid papers like this one (perhaps under M8).
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Adaptation" (M7) and "Memory" (M3) could be slightly sharper. M7 implies changes *in the rules* or parameters over time (learning), while M3 implies state persistence influencing output under *fixed* rules. This distinction worked here but might be tricky.
        *   "Embodied Computation" (M5.1) definition is good, but maybe add examples of what it *isn't* (e.g., external CPU controlling actuators).
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance was generally sufficient, but mapping complex dynamics like PNPS (M1/M2) or circuit behavior (M8) into simple nodes/edges is inherently reductive. Maybe suggest conventions for representing multi-step processes or feedback loops within the graph descriptions.
        *   Specifying *attributes* for edge types (e.g., `mechanism` for `TransductionEdge`) is helpful and could be made more explicit in the template instructions.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   The Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on interpreting the scale, which can be subjective. More granular examples for each level, specifically for *material systems*, would be beneficial.
        *   Calculating the CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) had ambiguity regarding which scores to include (e.g., binary 'Yes'/'No', scores from conditional modules). Specifying a precise formula (e.g., "Average of numeric scores in M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4 [if M4.1=Yes, else 0], M8.2, M9.2") would improve consistency.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Extracting quantitative energy efficiency (M2.3) or dissipation (M2.4) is often hard as papers rarely focus on this unless it's the main topic. The template rightly allows qualitative assessment.
        *   Distinguishing Implicit/Explicit/Mixed/Inferred requires careful judgment, especially when interpreting results against definitions (like self-organization or active inference). The framework forces critical evaluation, which is good.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very detailed and comprehensive, forcing a thorough analysis structured along CT-GIN principles. It's very useful for standardized data extraction. Its length makes it time-consuming, but necessarily so for the depth required. The conditional sections work well.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Clarify the formula for the CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1).
        *   Add brief examples specific to material systems for each level of the Cognizance Scale (M9.2).
        *   Consider adding an explicit probe for parameter tunability.
        *   Consider adding guidance on representing feedback loops or multi-component systems in the Knowledge Graph (M14).
