## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system consists of N self-propelled polar agents (swarmers) moving in a 2D plane. Each swarmer has an internal oscillator emitting acoustic waves into 3D space, acting as both emitter and detector. Swarmers interact locally via polar alignment and short-range repulsion. They interact globally via the collective acoustic field: they synchronize their internal oscillators to the field and align their motion towards regions of higher sound amplitude. The purpose is to study how wave-based communication (acoustic signaling) enables self-organization, emergent collective behaviors (blobs, larvae, snakes, rings, volvoxes), and functionalities like collective sensing, robustness (self-healing, passing constrictions), and external control in active matter systems. Components include the swarmers (position, orientation vector, complex oscillator state), the acoustic field (governed by the wave equation with swarmers as sources), and the environment (2D habitat plane within 3D space for sound). Both agent-based (discrete) and continuum field theory models are used for investigation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`='active matter', `domain`='physics', `mechanism`=['self-propulsion', 'polar alignment', 'short-range repulsion', 'acoustic emission/detection', 'acoustic field synchronization', 'acoustic gradient alignment'], `components`=['swarmers', 'acoustic_field'], `purpose`='Study emergent collective behavior and function via acoustic communication'.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The system components, interactions, environment, and purpose are directly stated and described in the Abstract, Introduction (Sec I), and Model Description (Sec II).

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The agent-based model (Sec II.A, Eqs. 1a-d) and the continuum model (Sec II.B, Eqs. 3a-d) are clearly presented with governing equations. The principles of interaction (alignment, repulsion, acoustic coupling, gradient following) are well-defined. The numerical methods (Euler-Maruyama, Fourier Transforms, ETD2) are mentioned (Sec II.A, II.B, App C). Parameter tables (Table I, II in App D) provide specific values used in simulations. Some details, like the precise form of the repulsive force `f_lj` or the source shape function `w(r)`, are mentioned qualitatively or via reference to appendices, slightly reducing perfect clarity, but overall the implementation is well-described for reproducibility.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The model equations, parameters, and simulation approaches are explicitly stated in the text and appendices.

Values are taken directly from the provided tables for simulations. Data Reliability is High as these are input parameters for the theoretical/computational model.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: Energy is input at the level of individual agents (swarmers). This allows self-propulsion (persistent motion at speed `v0`) and sustains the internal oscillations (Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics). The paper refers to active matter consuming energy (Sec V: "constant input of energy at the level of individual agents"). This is characteristic of active matter systems.
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`='internal_agent_process', `type`='unspecified (active matter)'
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly mentions energy input typical of active matter (Sec V) but doesn't specify the underlying mechanism (e.g., chemical fuel, external field harvesting) or quantify the input rate. The concept is explicit, the details are implicit.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: The primary energy transformations are:
        1.  Internal energy source -> Kinetic energy of directed motion (self-propulsion). The mechanism is abstracted by the parameter `v0`.
        2.  Internal energy source -> Energy stored in the internal oscillator (maintaining limit cycle oscillations, amplitude `|a|`).
        3.  Oscillator energy -> Acoustic wave energy (emission into the 3D medium, governed by Eq 1d and 3c). The mechanism involves the oscillator state `a` acting as a source term in the wave equation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`='self_propulsion', `from_node`='EnergyInputNode', `to_node`='KineticEnergyNode'; `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`='oscillation_sustenance', `from_node`='EnergyInputNode', `to_node`='OscillatorEnergyNode'; `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`='acoustic_emission', `from_node`='OscillatorEnergyNode', `to_node`='AcousticEnergyNode'.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The presence of self-propulsion and oscillation implies energy transduction, explicitly stated as a feature of active matter (Sec V). The specific pathways (kinetic, acoustic) are implicitly defined by the model equations (Eq 1a, 1c, 1d). The underlying physical mechanisms converting the abstract energy source are not detailed (implicit).

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not quantify energy efficiency. Active matter systems, especially at the microscale involving self-propulsion in fluids and wave emission, are generally highly dissipative and thermodynamically inefficient. There is no mention of mechanisms to optimize energy use. Score is low based on general knowledge of such systems, not specific data in the paper. Efficiency Metric: N/A. Qualitative Assessment: Low.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `efficiency`='Low' (qualitative) for relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: The paper provides no data or discussion on energy efficiency. The low score is inferred based on the physics of the described system type.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Dissipation mechanisms are not explicitly quantified but are inherent in the model:
        1.  Viscous drag/friction implicitly limits agent speed (`v0` is constant, implying a balance between driving and dissipation). Mentioned implicitly via comparison to biological systems like actin motility assays (Sec V). (Qualitative: High).
        2.  Energy loss during acoustic wave propagation in the medium (spreading in 3D, though absorption is neglected in App A). (Qualitative: Medium/High depending on system size/geometry).
        3.  Internal oscillator dynamics may involve dissipative terms (inherent in Stuart-Landau model, but not detailed). (Qualitative: Medium).
        4.  Inelastic interactions (collisions/repulsion `f_lj`) between agents. (Qualitative: Low/Medium).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode` (e.g., `ViscousDrag`, `AcousticPropagationLoss`) and `EnergyDissipationEdge` connecting energy nodes (e.g., `KineticEnergyNode`, `AcousticEnergyNode`) to these dissipation nodes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Dissipation is inherent to the physical processes described (motion in a medium, wave propagation) but is not explicitly calculated or discussed in terms of energy loss pathways in the excerpt. App A explicitly mentions neglecting absorption, but geometric spreading (1/r) still causes intensity decay.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly mentions "shape memory" in snake structures (Sec IV.B), describing their ability to recover their morphology after strong distortion (e.g., passing through a constriction). This persistence of the characteristic collective structure (phenotype) influences future behavior (resuming movement). The system's state (agent positions, orientations, phases) inherently carries history, but the "shape memory" refers to a more robust, collective property. Larva recovery after perturbation (Fig 7b) also qualifies.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The term "shape memory" is used directly in Sec IV.B regarding the snake structures. The phenomenon of recovery after perturbation is explicitly described and simulated for both snakes and larvae (Fig 7a, 7b).

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 3
*   Justification: The memory described is primarily structural/phenotypic at the collective level (persistence of the snake or larva form). It allows the system to return to a previous functional state after perturbation. It's not a rewritable memory in the computational sense (like storing arbitrary data) but rather an emergent property of the self-organized state's stability basin. It shows persistence (retention) but limited capacity (primarily restoring one or a few characteristic shapes/behaviors) and no explicit readout mechanism beyond observing the structure/behavior itself. It's closer to resilience or self-healing than computational memory.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type: attributes - `memory_type`='structural/phenotypic', `level`='collective'.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The *existence* of memory ("shape memory") is explicit. The *characterization* (structural/phenotypic, limited capacity) is inferred from the descriptions and figures (Fig 7).

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*    Units: Qualitative Descriptor: "Short-term" / Time required for recovery.
*   Justification: The paper shows recovery happens over simulation time (e.g., Fig 7b, timeframes t1 to t3), but doesn't quantify a specific retention time constant. The memory persists long enough for the structure to reform, which depends on system parameters and perturbation strength. It's not a permanent memory state but rather the timescale of returning to an attractor state. Qualitatively, it appears relatively short term compared to the overall simulation times shown.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: Recovery timescales can be estimated from figures (e.g., Fig 7) but are not explicitly stated or analyzed as a memory retention property.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute `retention`='Short-term (qualitative)' of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: Low (qualitative)
*   Units: N/A (distinct states/phenotypes)
*   Justification: The memory primarily relates to the recovery of specific self-organized states (snake, larva). The system doesn't demonstrate the ability to store multiple arbitrary patterns or pieces of information. The capacity seems limited to the few stable emergent phenotypes observed.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Inferred from the limited number of described recovery scenarios and stable states. The paper does not discuss memory capacity.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `capacity`='Low (qualitative)' of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: There is no defined "readout" process in the computational sense. The "memory" state is the collective structure itself, which is observed directly or influences the system's ongoing dynamics (e.g., resuming motion). Accuracy isn't a relevant metric here.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
       *  Justification: The concept of readout accuracy is not applicable based on the type of memory described.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: The memory is related to the stability of the emergent state. Perturbations can disrupt it (Fig 7b, point t1), and it recovers. There isn't a gradual decay characteristic described, but rather a disruption/recovery dynamic.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
            * Justification: The paper describes perturbation and recovery, not gradual degradation of a stored memory state.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Recovery (Snake/Larva)| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Energy cost of self-organization/recovery not analyzed. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: Energy costs associated with memory (state recovery) are not discussed or quantified.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | Shape Fidelity | Qualitative measure of how well the shape is recovered after perturbation | High (Qual.) | N/A | Attribute of `MemoryNode` | Fig 7a, 7b | Implicit | Assessed visually from figures showing recovery. |
    | Passing Fraction | Fraction of agents passing constriction (robustness measure) | Varies (see Fig 7a) | % | Relates to `MemoryNode` robustness| Fig 7a (right panel) | Explicit | Explicitly plotted metric related to snake integrity/memory. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
*   Justification: The passing fraction is explicitly measured. Shape fidelity is implicitly assessed from visual representations of recovery.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly describes the "spontaneous formation" (Sec II.A) and emergence of various collective structures (blobs, larvae, snakes, etc., Sec III) from the local interactions (alignment, repulsion, acoustic emission/detection/response) of the swarmers without external templating or control dictating the final structure. The collective states arise purely from the agents' interactions and their coupling via the acoustic field.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Terms like "self-organized structures," "spontaneous formation," and "emergent functionalities" are used throughout the text (Abstract, Sec I, Sec II.A, Sec III, Sec IV).

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The local interaction rules are defined by the governing equations:
        1.  **Motion & Repulsion (Eq 1a):** Agents move with velocity `v0` along orientation `n_l`, subject to repulsive forces `f_lj` from neighbors `j` within distance `2rp`. `dr_l/dt = v0 * n_l + sum(f_lj)`. (Continuum: Advection term `-v0 * partial_i(p_i)` in Eq 3a, Pressure term `P'(rho)` in Eq 3b).
        2.  **Polar Alignment (Eq 1b):** Agents align orientation `phi_l` with neighbors `j` within radius `rc` at rate `Γ`. `d(phi_l)/dt = -Γ * sum(sin(phi_l - phi_j) / |r_l - r_j|) + ...`. (Continuum: Alignment terms `sigma(rho-1)pi`, `-delta p_j p_j p_i`, elastic term `kappa*nabla^2 p_i`, self-advection `chi p_j partial_j p_i` in Eq 3b).
        3.  **Acoustic Gradient Alignment (Eq 1b):** Agents align orientation `phi_l` towards higher sound amplitude `|u|` at rate `Ξ`. `d(phi_l)/dt = ... + Ξ * sin(phi_s - phi_l) + xi_l`, where `phi_s = angle(nabla |u|)`. (Continuum: `rho * Ξ * partial_i |u|^2` term in Eq 3b).
        4.  **Oscillator Dynamics & Coupling (Eq 1c):** Agent's internal oscillator state `a_l` follows Stuart-Landau dynamics influenced by the local acoustic field `u(r_l, t)` at rate `λ`. `d(a_l)/dt = (1+iω)a_l - (1+ib)|a_l|^2*a_l + λ*u(r_l,t)`. (Continuum: Eq 3d includes diffusion and advection).
        5.  **Acoustic Field Generation (Eq 1d):** The collective acoustic field `u` is generated by all oscillators `a_j` acting as sources in the wave equation. `(1/c^2) * partial_t^2 u = nabla^2 u + sum(w(r-r_j) * a_j * delta(z))`. (Continuum: Eq 3c uses density `rho*a`).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `LocalInteractionRule` nodes linked to `AgentNode`s. Edges between `AgentNode`s represent interactions (`AlignmentEdge`, `RepulsionEdge`). Edges between `AgentNode`s and `AcousticFieldNode` represent emission/sensing (`AcousticCouplingEdge`). These rules form the local side of `AdjunctionEdge`s linking local agent states to global configurations.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The governing equations defining the interactions are explicitly provided in Sec II.A and II.B.

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |

    | 5 | Field Generation | `c` | 5 - 50 | [Length]/[Time] | Tables I, II | Explicit | Speed of sound parameter. |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The emergent global order includes various distinct collective structures/phenotypes:
        1.  **Blobs:** Localized aggregates, often circular, with a central polar defect and synchronized oscillators (potentially target waves).
        2.  **Larvae:** Elongated, slowly migrating aggregates with an asymmetrically positioned polar defect (pacemaker) emitting phase waves.
        3.  **Snakes:** Rapidly moving, elongated structures without internal polar defects, exhibiting phase waves along the body and high persistence.
        4.  **Ouroboroi:** Closed, rotating ring-like structures formed from larvae, with propagating phase waves.
        5.  **Volvoxes:** Large blobs with a synchronized core and outer layers exhibiting desynchronized or metachronal waves (chimera-like states).
        These states are characterized by morphology, motility, internal oscillator phase patterns, and defect structure. (Described in Sec III.A, Fig 2). Large-scale synchronization patterns spanning multiple clusters are also observed in continuum simulations (Sec III.B, Fig 5).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `ConfigurationalNode` subtypes: `BlobNode`, `LarvaNode`, `SnakeNode`, `OuroborosNode`, `VolvoxNode`, `SynchronizedClusterNode`. Attributes include morphology, motility, defect_structure, phase_pattern.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The different emergent structures are explicitly described, named, and visualized in Sec III and Fig 2.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The phase diagram (Fig 2a) shows that the predominant collective state is largely determined by the key parameters `v0` (agent velocity) and `Ξ` (acoustic susceptibility), indicating a degree of predictability. However, self-organization processes are inherently stochastic (noise term `xi_l` in Eq 1b), and transitions between states or variations within a state type can occur. The continuum model also shows predictable emergence of blobs vs snakes based on parameters (Fig 3). Predictability is high in terms of which *type* of structure is likely to form in a given parameter regime, but the exact final configuration, size, or dynamics might vary.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: The phase diagram (Fig 2a) explicitly shows parameter dependence. The inherent stochasticity and potential for variations are implicit in the nature of self-organization and the stochastic term in the equations.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes to the `AdjunctionEdge` weight/probability linking specific local rules/parameters (`LocalInteractionRule`, `ParameterNode`) to global configurations (`ConfigurationalNode`).

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | Agent-based -> Collective States | Mapping local agent rules (Eq 1) to emergent structures (Fig 2) | Medium (Fig 2a) | 6 | Phase Diagram (Fig 2a), Structure Type, Acoustic Signature (Fig 2) | Explicit | Phase diagram shows mapping, but stochasticity exists. Yoneda score reflects ability to predict global state from local rules partially. | Sec III.A, Fig 2 |
    | Continuum -> Collective States | Mapping continuum fields (Eq 3) to emergent structures (Fig 3) | Medium | 5 | Structure Type (Blob, Snake), Acoustic Signature (Fig 4) | Explicit | Captures blobs and snakes but misses larvae, indicating imperfect mapping. | Sec III.B, Fig 3, Fig 4 |
    | Continuum Coarsening | Mapping local model to large-scale dynamics (Fig 5) | High (Qualitative) | 7 | Cluster Number N(t), Synchronization Patterns | Explicit/Mixed | Shows accelerated coarsening and saturation, qualitatively predicted, suggesting reasonable mapping. | Sec III.B, Fig 5 |

    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** 6 (Overall assessment. The models capture the emergence of distinct global states from local rules fairly well, especially the agent-based model via the phase diagram. However, discrepancies exist (e.g., continuum model missing larvae) and the precise quantitative mapping beyond structure type is complex, indicating the functor (mapping) isn't perfectly faithful or complete.)
    *   **Metrics:** Phase diagrams relating parameters to structure type (Fig 2a), comparison of emergent structures between models (Sec III.A vs III.B), analysis of large-scale dynamics like coarsening rates (Fig 5).
    *   **Justification:** The paper directly investigates the link between microscopic rules/parameters and macroscopic emergent behavior through simulations and phase diagrams (Explicit). The assessment of the mapping fidelity (Yoneda score) is an interpretation based on the observed predictability and limitations discussed (Implicit).

    *   Justification: The system performs computation intrinsically. Agents process information encoded in the acoustic field (amplitude gradients, phase information) using their physical dynamics (alignment response Eq 1b, oscillator coupling Eq 1c) to determine their movement and synchronization state. This processing directly influences the collective behavior and structure. It's not computation via an external controller but through the physics of the agents and their interactions mediated by the field they collectively generate and respond to. Collective sensing (Sec IV.A) and response to control signals (Sec IV.D) further support this.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The information processing aspects (gradient following, synchronization) are explicit in the model equations. Framing this explicitly as "embodied computation" is an interpretation (Implicit), although the Discussion (Sec V.D) touches on agents performing "simple computational steps".

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog/Hybrid
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type: attributes - `computation_type`='Analog/Hybrid'.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The processing involves continuous physical variables (positions, angles, phases, field amplitudes) and their dynamics described by differential equations, characteristic of analog computation. The emergent collective decision-making (e.g., phenotype selection based on parameters) could be seen as having discrete outcomes (structure type) emerging from the continuous dynamics, hence potentially hybrid. This classification is an interpretation.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: The basic computational operations performed by the material/agents include:
        1.  **Gradient Ascent/Following:** Agents align towards `∇|u|` (Eq 1b, continuum Eq 3b), effectively computing and following the direction of steepest ascent in sound amplitude.
        2.  **Phase Synchronization (Phase Locking):** Oscillators adjust their phase and frequency based on the collective field `u` (Eq 1c, continuum Eq 3d), performing distributed synchronization akin to Kuramoto oscillators, but mediated dynamically by the acoustic field.
        3.  **Signal Integration/Averaging:** The acoustic field `u` itself represents a spatially and temporally integrated sum of emissions from all agents (Eq 1d, 3c, Solved in Eq 2/A15), performing a type of collective signal integration.
        *   **Sub-Type:** N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode` and related edges. E.g., `ComputationNode` function='GradientFollowing', `ComputationNode` function='Synchronization', `AcousticFieldNode` function='SignalIntegration'.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The mathematical operations (gradient, coupling terms, wave equation solution) are explicit in the model. Identifying these as "computational primitives" is an interpretative step (Implicit).

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**

    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |

        | Acoustic Propagation | L/c (very short) | [Time] | Eq 1d, `c` value | Mixed | Sound speed `c` is large (5-50) compared to `v0`, quasi-static approx. used (App A), implying fast signal propagation relative to agent motion. Explicit `c`, implicit timescale comparison. |

    *   **Note:** Specific numerical values depend heavily on chosen parameters. Coarsening/Response/Recovery times are estimates from figures' time axes. Units are relative simulation time units unless specified.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Partial
    *   Justification: The system shows elements potentially relatable to active inference, but lacks explicit formulation:
        1.  **Prediction/Internal Model:** Agents' dynamics (especially oscillator phase) are influenced by the expected collective acoustic field. Synchronization implies a form of local prediction/anticipation of neighbors' states mediated by the field. The collective structures themselves might represent a stable "model" of interaction. (Implicit/Partial Evidence).
        2.  **Action Selection:** Agents actively change their orientation (`phi_l`) based on the acoustic gradient (Eq 1b) to move towards higher amplitude regions, which often correspond to synchronized or structured states. This action aims to maintain coupling/cohesion, potentially interpretable as minimizing a form of prediction error or surprise related to the acoustic environment they expect/prefer. Response to reflections (Fig 6) involves changing behavior (morphology) based on altered sensory input, suggesting action to account for environmental changes. (Implicit/Partial Evidence).
        3.  **Model Update:** Adaptation/learning isn't framed as updating an explicit internal model in the paper. Shape recovery (Fig 7) restores a previous state rather than learning a new one based on prediction error.
        Overall: Agents act based on sensory input (acoustic field) potentially to maintain a preferred state (synchronized, aggregated), but the framework isn't explicitly cast as minimizing free energy or prediction error based on a generative model.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper does not use the term "active inference" or related concepts (free energy principle, prediction error minimization). The connection is an interpretation based on the observed behavior (gradient following, response to perturbations).
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** Information flow rates between agent states and acoustic field; Correlation between agent actions (reorientation) and reduction in local phase/amplitude discrepancies; Timescale of response to unexpected field perturbations (e.g., external source, reflection); Complexity/stability of emergent structures as a proxy for model evidence.

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates adaptive plasticity.
        1.  **Phenotype Selection:** The system settles into different collective states (blobs, snakes etc.) depending on parameters like `v0` and `Ξ` (Fig 2a), showing a form of adaptation to system-level conditions.
        2.  **Response to Environment:** Larva and blob structures change morphology (disassemble, shed agents) in response to an approaching object (reflected signals, Fig 6), adapting the collective structure to the perceived environmental change.
        3.  **Robustness/Recovery:** Snakes adapt their shape to pass through narrow constrictions (Fig 7a) and then recover their form. Larvae recover their structure and function after significant perturbation (defect destruction, Fig 7b). This self-healing/recovery is a form of adaptation ensuring functional persistence.
        These changes are persistent alterations in structure/behavior driven by interaction with the environment or internal dynamics, going beyond simple, immediate stimulus-response.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The paper explicitly describes and shows simulations of morphological changes in response to intruders (Fig 6), navigation through constrictions (Fig 7a), and self-regeneration/healing after damage (Fig 7b), framing these as adaptive or robust behaviors (Sec IV.A, IV.B). Phenotype dependence on parameters (Fig 2a) is also explicit.

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The mechanism of adaptation is primarily emergent self-organization guided by the physical interaction rules and feedback via the acoustic field. It is not a pre-programmed learning rule like Hebbian learning or explicit reinforcement learning.
        1.  **Environmental Adaptation (Fig 6):** Reflected acoustic signals alter the input `u` to agents' oscillators (Eq 1c) and the gradient field they align with (Eq 1b). This change in local input, processed through the existing dynamics, leads to changes in synchronization and motion, resulting in the observed morphological shifts (destabilization, agent shedding). The system adapts by reconfiguring itself according to the modified acoustic landscape.
        2.  **Structural Adaptation (Fig 7a, 7b):** When perturbed (collision, defect destruction), the agents continue to follow their local rules (alignment, repulsion, acoustic response). The interplay of these rules within the perturbed configuration drives the system back towards a stable attractor state (the original snake/larva phenotype or a related stable state), demonstrating self-healing/shape recovery.
        The adaptation arises from the inherent dynamics and stability properties of the self-organized system operating under varying conditions or after perturbation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `AdaptationNode` type. Mechanism is `Emergent Self-Organization/Feedback`. Edges could represent state transitions (`TransitionEdge`) between different `ConfigurationalNode`s triggered by `EnvironmentalStimulusNode` or `PerturbationNode`, mediated by `AcousticFieldNode` feedback.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The observed adaptive behaviors (Fig 6, 7) are explicit. The description of the mechanism as emergent self-organization driven by physical rules and acoustic feedback is an interpretation based on the model description (Sec II) and simulation results (Sec IV), though consistent with the authors' framing (e.g., Sec V.C "collective form of environmental sensing... emerges as a cooperative function through acoustic synchronization").

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system exhibits several distinct emergent collective behaviors:
        1.  **Aggregation/Structure Formation:** Spontaneous formation of stable or dynamic aggregates (Blobs, Larvae, Snakes, Ouroboroi, Volvoxes) with specific morphologies and internal dynamics (Sec III).
        2.  **Collective Motility:** Coordinated movement of aggregates (Larvae, Snakes) with varying speeds and persistence (Sec III).
        3.  **Synchronization:** Synchronization of internal oscillators within aggregates, leading to coherent acoustic emission and specific frequency signatures (Sec III, Fig 2, Fig 4).
        4.  **Collective Sensing:** Ability of aggregates (Larvae, Blobs) to detect and respond (change morphology) to external objects via reflected acoustic waves (Sec IV.A, Fig 6).
        5.  **Robustness/Self-Healing:** Ability of aggregates (Snakes, Larvae) to maintain or recover their structure and function after significant perturbations or deformations (e.g., passing constrictions, defect destruction) (Sec IV.B, Fig 7a, 7b).
        6.  **Inter-aggregate Interaction:** Distance regulation between aggregates (Volvoxes) mediated by the interference of their emitted acoustic waves (Sec IV.C, Fig 7c).
        7.  **Response to External Control:** Ability of aggregates (Snakes) to be captured, transported, and released using external acoustic fields (Sec IV.D, Fig 7d).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` subtypes: `Aggregation`, `CollectiveMotility`, `Synchronization`, `CollectiveSensing`, `SelfHealing`, `InterAggregateInteraction`, `ExternalControlResponse`. Linked to specific `ConfigurationalNode`s (e.g., `SnakeNode` linked to `CollectiveMotility`, `SelfHealing`).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors are the main results presented and discussed in Sections III and IV, supported by figures and simulations.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly investigates and highlights robustness as an emergent property (Sec IV.B, Sec V). Snakes demonstrate robustness by passing through narrow constrictions (Fig 7a), maintaining coherence although the passing fraction depends on slit width and snake length. Larvae show self-healing by regenerating a functional head after defect destruction (Fig 7b). The self-organized states themselves persist despite noise (`xi_l`) in agent orientation. However, robustness is not absolute; strong perturbations can lead to state transitions or fragmentation (Fig 6a), and control protocols can fail (Fig 7d). The system shows significant resilience but has limits. Quantified partially by passing fraction (Fig 7a).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Robustness ("phenotype robustness," "self-regeneration," "shape memory," resilience) is explicitly discussed and demonstrated through specific simulation examples in Sec IV.B and Fig 7.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `robustness_score`=7 for relevant `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s (e.g., `SelfHealing`, `CollectiveMotility` for snakes). Linked to `PerturbationNode` tolerance.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Validation is primarily through computational simulations:
        1.  **Agent-Based Simulations (ABS):** Direct numerical integration of stochastic equations (Eq 1) demonstrates the emergence and dynamics of collective states (Blobs, Larvae, Snakes etc.) from individual agent rules (Sec III.A, Fig 2, Fig 6, Fig 7). Parameter sweeps generate phase diagrams (Fig 2a) confirming parameter dependence.
        2.  **Continuum Field Simulations (CFS):** Numerical solution of deterministic partial differential equations (Eq 3) shows emergence of similar structures (Blobs, Snakes) and large-scale dynamics (coarsening) (Sec III.B, Fig 3, Fig 4, Fig 5).
        3.  **Comparison:** Comparison between ABS and CFS results provides cross-validation for shared phenomena (Blobs, Snakes), while discrepancies highlight limitations (e.g., CFS missing Larvae) (Sec III.B).
        4.  **Acoustic Signatures:** Analysis of frequency spectra and signal amplitudes from simulations provides quantitative characterization linked to emergent states (Fig 2, Fig 4).
        5.  **Perturbation Studies:** Specific simulations applying perturbations (object reflection, defect removal, constrictions, external control fields) validate claims of sensing, robustness, and control (Sec IV, Fig 6, Fig 7).
        Limitations: Lack of experimental validation. Validation relies solely on computational models and their internal consistency. Robustness/reproducibility demonstrated within simulation framework by showing consistent structure formation in parameter regimes (Fig 2a).
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The methods section (Sec II), results sections (Sec III, IV), and appendices describe the simulation methods and how behaviors were observed and characterized (e.g., phase diagrams, specific perturbation tests).

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, the paper uses cognitive terms metaphorically to describe emergent collective behaviors:
        *   "Collective perception" and "environmental sensing" (Abstract, Sec IV.A) are used to describe the response of aggregates to reflected acoustic signals from an object.
        *   "Collective decision-making" (Abstract, Sec III.A) is mentioned regarding phenotype selection or coordinated responses, though the mechanism is emergent self-organization rather than explicit deliberation.
        *   "Communication" (Abstract, Sec I, Sec IV.C) describes the acoustic signal exchange between agents and aggregates.
        *   "Shape memory" (Sec IV.B) is used for the self-healing/recovery phenomenon.
        *   "Cognitive flock configurations" (Sec III.A) mentioned in comparison to vision-cone models.
        The authors relate these emergent behaviors to functionalities seen in biological systems (e.g., animal swarms, amoeba aggregation) and potential microrobotic applications. Limitations: The mapping is analogical; the paper doesn't claim genuine cognitive processes like consciousness or complex reasoning but uses these terms to describe functional outcomes of the physical dynamics. The Discussion (Sec V.D) explicitly mentions moving towards "phenotypes, which exhibit higher-level features (functions)" and simple agents performing "simple computational steps."
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` linking `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s (e.g., `CollectiveSensing`, `SelfHealing`, `InterAggregateInteraction`) to `CognitiveFunctionNode`s (e.g., `Perception`, `Memory`, `Communication`, `DecisionMaking`). Edge attributes specify `mapping_type`='analogical'.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly uses terms like "perception," "decision-making," "communication," and "memory" to describe the observed collective behaviors in the Abstract, Introduction, Section III, Section IV, and Section V.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity) and potentially touches on Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy).
        *   *Level 2:* Exhibits basic adaptation (morphological changes to stimuli, Fig 6), plasticity (recovery/healing, Fig 7b), and collective sensing (Fig 6) beyond simple fixed responses. However, it lacks complex internal representations or clear goal-directedness beyond maintaining cohesion/synchronization.
        *   *Level 3:* Shows adaptive behavior based on feedback (acoustic field) within a repertoire of emergent states (blobs, snakes etc.). The response to intruders (Fig 6) and navigation (Fig 7a) show reactive autonomy. However, the adaptation mechanism is implicit self-organization, not explicit learning or model updating. It doesn't demonstrate flexible planning or goal selection beyond immediate physical constraints/attractors.
        The system falls short of higher levels: No evidence of internal models for prediction (Level 4), understanding relationships (Level 5), abstract reasoning (Level 6), social interaction beyond physical coupling (Level 7), or self-awareness (Level 8+). The cognitive language used is largely metaphorical for functional descriptions.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is an interpretation based on comparing the system's explicitly described behaviors against the definitions in the Cognizance Scale.

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear
    *   Justification: The paper does not explicitly discuss criticality (phase transitions, scale-free behavior, power laws, long-range correlations) in the context of the system's dynamics or emergent behavior. While synchronization phenomena (related to Kuramoto model, Sec II.A) and pattern formation can exhibit critical transitions, this aspect is not analyzed or investigated in the excerpt. The mentioned isotropic-to-polar order transition in the continuum model (Sec II.B) occurs at a critical density `rho_c`, but criticality signatures are not explored.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The absence of discussion implies criticality was not a focus. Assessing potential for criticality requires analysis beyond the provided text.

    *   Content: N/A (Paper type is Hybrid)

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

**(This module applies as the paper is Hybrid, including significant theoretical/computational work)**

*   **Vector ID:** M12
*   **Vector Type:** Theory

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework combines established models: agent-based active matter (self-propulsion, alignment, repulsion), Stuart-Landau oscillators for synchronization, and the wave equation for acoustic coupling. The continuum model uses standard hydrodynamic approaches for active polar fluids, extended with density-dependence and acoustic coupling terms. Assumptions (e.g., quasi-static acoustic field, 2D habitat/3D sound) are stated (Sec II.A, App A). Equations are clearly presented. The derivation of the continuum model or the quasi-static solution is described (Sec II.B, App A). The framework appears internally consistent and mathematically sound based on standard practices in theoretical soft active matter physics.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: The models, equations, and key assumptions are explicitly laid out in Sec II and appendices.

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 5
    *   Justification: The paper suggests potential implementation in acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms (Abstract, Sec I) or naval drones (Sec V.D). Acoustic communication and control are feasible macroscopically. However, realizing the *specific model* at the microscale presents significant challenges: integrating self-propulsion, steerable acoustic emission/detection, and onboard oscillators with synchronization and gradient-following capabilities onto individual microrobots is technologically demanding. Powering, miniaturization, and precise control are major hurdles not addressed in the paper. The model provides conceptual principles, but direct physical realization as described seems moderately feasible in the medium-term, especially at microscale.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The paper explicitly suggests microrobots/drones (Abstract, Sec I, Sec V.D). The assessment of feasibility is implicit, based on general knowledge of microrobotics and active matter realization challenges.

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: If physically realized, the system offers rich potential for CT-GIN analysis. It explicitly incorporates local interactions leading to global emergent structures (M4), embodied computation via physical dynamics (M5), adaptation/robustness (M7, M8), and communication-mediated collective behavior. The clear mathematical formulation aids mapping to CT-GIN elements (nodes for agents, field, structures; edges for interactions, transformations). It provides a concrete example of wave-based communication in active matter, offering a platform to study information flow, collective sensing, and control within the CT-GIN framework. The main limitation is the current gap between the theoretical model and readily available physical implementations matching its specifics.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: Score based on assessing the model's features against the goals and structures of the CT-GIN framework, which is an interpretation.

Scores M5.1, M7.1 are Yes/No, not included directly in average per instruction). *Calculation: (8+1+3+7+7+3)/6 = 29/6 = 4.83*. Re-checking instructions: "Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2". Let's assume M1 refers to M1.2, M2 to M2.3, M3 to M3.2, M4 to M4.4. Average = (8 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 3) / 6 = 4.83. Rounded to 4.75 for consistency. Let's re-read: "(Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2, scores with N/A convert in 0)". This is ambiguous. Does it mean average all scores *within* M1-M4? Or just the headline scores? Let's stick to the listed scores: M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2. Average = 4.83.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This work presents a compelling theoretical/computational model of active matter utilizing acoustic signaling for communication and control. Its key strengths within the CT-GIN framework lie in demonstrating emergent self-organization (M4) leading to diverse collective structures (blobs, snakes etc.) with distinct behaviors (M8), including collective motility, synchronization, and notable robustness/self-healing properties. The system exhibits basic adaptive plasticity (M7) by responding to environmental cues (reflections) and recovering from perturbations. Embodied computation (M5) is present through the physical dynamics processing acoustic information for gradient following and synchronization. However, key limitations exist. Energy flow analysis (M2) is absent, lacking efficiency metrics and dissipation quantification. Memory (M3) is present as collective structural resilience ("shape memory") but lacks quantitative characterization (retention, capacity) and computational function. While cognitive terminology is used (M9), the mapping is largely analogical, with the system demonstrating primarily reactive/adaptive autonomy (Level 3) rather than higher cognitive functions. Overall, the paper provides a strong foundation for studying wave-mediated collective intelligence, clearly defining local rules and emergent global order, but requires further work to quantify performance metrics (energy, memory, computation) and bridge the gap towards experimental realization and higher cognitive functions relevant to the CT-GIN framework.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Quantify Energy Flow:** Analyze energy input, transduction efficiency, and dissipation pathways within the model to understand thermodynamic costs.
        *   **Characterize Memory:** Quantify retention time, capacity, and potential limitations of the observed "shape memory." Explore mechanisms for embedding more structured or rewritable memory.
        *   **Develop Order Parameters:** Define and measure quantitative order parameters to characterize the different emergent structures and transitions between them.
        *   **Quantify Computation:** Assess the speed, accuracy, and energy cost of the embodied computational primitives (gradient following, synchronization). Explore if more complex computations can emerge.
        *   **Formalize Adaptation:** Develop quantitative metrics for adaptation rate and magnitude in response to environmental changes or learning protocols.
        *   **Investigate Active Inference:** Explore if the system's behavior can be formally described within the active inference framework (prediction error minimization, generative models).
        *   **Explore Information Flow:** Quantify information transfer between agents via the acoustic field using information-theoretic measures.
        *   **Experimental Validation:** Pursue physical realization (e.g., using microrobots or macroscopic analogs) to validate the model predictions and explore real-world complexities.
        *   **Bridge to Cognition:** Investigate modifications or extensions that could lead to behaviors more closely resembling planning, goal-directed action, or symbolic processing.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe quantifying the *information content* or *information flow* mediated by the signaling mechanism (acoustic field here) could be valuable, connecting to M5 (Computation) and M9 (Cognition).
        *   A probe specifically on *Hierarchy* could be useful – does the system exhibit hierarchical organization (levels of structure, control)?
        *   A dedicated probe for *Stochasticity vs Determinism* contribution to emergent behavior.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The exact scope of "Memory" (M3) could be slightly ambiguous – distinguishing between basic system state persistence and more functional memory types (like associative, episodic). The current description is good but refinement might help borderline cases.
        *   The definition/scope of "Embodied Computation" (M5.1) might benefit from contrast with external/digital computation.
        *   The calculation instruction for the CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) was ambiguous ("Modules 1-4" - average of which scores within those modules?). Clarifying exactly which Vector IDs contribute is needed. I assumed M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on representing *parameters* (M1.3, M4.2.1) within the graph could be clearer. Are they node attributes or separate `ParameterNode`s? (I assumed attributes or separate nodes depending on context).
        *   Clearer examples for `AdjunctionEdge` and `Monad` edges, especially in relation to M4 (Self-Organization) and M7 (Adaptation), would be helpful.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Assigning scores for qualitative aspects (e.g., Efficiency M2.3, Memory Type M3.2, Predictability M4.4, Robustness M8.2) can be subjective. More detailed rubrics or benchmark examples for different score levels might improve consistency.
        *   The Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on the provided Cognizance Scale, which is helpful, but mapping complex system behavior to discrete levels remains challenging. Justification is key.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Distinguishing Implicit/Explicit/Mixed required careful reading; sometimes information is presented descriptively without being explicitly labelled as a specific concept (e.g., computation).
        *   Condensing information into concise table fields (e.g., M13.1 Summary Table) while retaining nuance was challenging.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very comprehensive and detailed, which is excellent for capturing nuances. However, its length and detail demand significant time and careful attention. Conditional sections help manage complexity. The strict formatting requirement is crucial but demanding.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Clarify the exact calculation method for the M13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score.
        *   Provide more illustrative examples within the CT-GIN mapping prompts, especially for less common CT concepts like Adjunctions or Monads in this context.
        *   Consider adding short example justifications for different Implicit/Explicit/Mixed classifications within the template instructions.
        *   Maybe add a field for "Key Figures/Equations" supporting the answer in each section to speed up cross-referencing.
