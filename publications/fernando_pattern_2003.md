## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system uses the surface waves generated in a bucket of water as a computational medium, analogous to a Liquid State Machine (LSM) or Reservoir Computer. Inputs are provided by electric motors vibrating the water surface. The resulting interference patterns are captured by a camera via an overhead projector setup. These patterns (frames) are pre-processed (Sobel filter, thresholding, averaging) and fed into a simple linear perceptron (or multiple perceptrons in parallel) for classification tasks (XOR, speech recognition). The core idea is that the complex, high-dimensional dynamics of water waves transform temporally complex inputs into spatially complex patterns that are linearly separable by the perceptron. The system components include a water tank, electric motors (inputs), a computer controller, an overhead projector, a screen, a webcam (output sensor), and a computer running perceptron algorithms (readout). Its purpose is to demonstrate pattern recognition using a physical, non-neural dynamical system as the computational pre-processor.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Hybrid (Physical Reservoir + Digital Readout), `domain`: Physics/Computer Science, `mechanism`: Reservoir Computing (Liquid State Machine Analogy), `components`: [Water Tank, Water, Motors, Projector, Camera, Computer, Perceptron Algorithm], `purpose`: Pattern Recognition (XOR, Speech) using physical dynamics.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The abstract, introduction, and methods sections explicitly describe the components, setup, operation, and purpose of the system.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper provides a reasonably clear description of the experimental setup (Fig 1, Section 2), the components used (motors, projector, camera), the data acquisition process (frame rate, resolution, pre-processing steps like Sobel filter, grid averaging), and the readout mechanism (perceptron with p-delta rule). The specific tasks (XOR, speech) and input encoding methods are also described. Some details are missing (e.g., specific motor frequencies/amplitudes for XOR, exact dimensions, water properties, precise Sobel/threshold parameters), but the overall implementation is largely understandable and reproducible in principle.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: Most aspects are explicitly stated in Section 2 and Figures 1-3, but some finer details would need to be inferred or assumed for exact reproduction.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Camera Resolution | 320x240 | pixels | Section 2 | Explicit | High | N/A |

        | Speech Sample Rate | 12 | kHz | Section 2.2 | Explicit | High | N/A |

    *   **Note:** Other parameters like motor frequencies, water depth, tank dimensions are mentioned qualitatively or implicitly but not quantified precisely. Speech pre-processing creates an 8x8 matrix per sample.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy sources are electrical: power supplied to the computer (controlling motors, running perceptron, processing camera data), the electric motors (actuators), the overhead projector (light source), and the webcam (sensor).
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A (implicitly Watts)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Electrical Grid, `type`: Electrical. Multiples nodes representing inputs to computer, motors, projector, camera.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper mentions the use of electric motors, a computer, a projector, and a camera, all of which require electrical energy, but does not explicitly state or quantify the energy input.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: 1. Electrical energy (computer control signal) -> Electrical energy (motor driver) -> Mechanical energy (motor vibration) -> Kinetic energy (water waves). 2. Electrical energy -> Light energy (projector bulb). 3. Light energy -> Modulated light pattern (passing through/reflecting off water waves). 4. Modulated light pattern -> Electrical signals (camera sensor pixels). 5. Electrical signals -> Digital data (computer processing & perceptron). The key transduction is electrical input to motors causing mechanical waves, whose spatial pattern (captured optically) represents the computation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: [Electromechanical (Motor), Fluid Dynamics (Wave Generation), Optical (Projection/Imaging), Photoelectric (Camera)], `from_node`: [ElectricalInput, MechanicalEnergy, LightEnergy, ModulatedLight], `to_node`: [MechanicalEnergy, KineticEnergy (Waves), ModulatedLight, ElectricalSignal].
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper describes the physical setup and processes involved, allowing the inference of the energy transduction steps based on the function of each component, although the mechanisms are not explicitly detailed in energy terms.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification/Metrics: Extremely low. The vast majority of electrical energy input is likely dissipated as heat (motors, projector, computer), sound (motors), and light not captured by the camera. The energy used to create the specific wave patterns relevant for computation is minuscule compared to the total energy consumption of the apparatus. No quantitative efficiency metrics are provided. Qualitative assessment: Low.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute (`efficiency`: Low) of relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: The inefficiency is inferred from the nature of the components used (projector, motors, general-purpose computer) and the physics involved (wave dissipation). The paper makes no claims about efficiency.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Major dissipation mechanisms include: Heat loss from the computer, electric motors, and overhead projector. Viscous damping of water waves. Sound energy from motors. Light energy from the projector not contributing to the image formation on the camera sensor (scattered/absorbed). Electrical resistance in wiring. Friction in motor mechanisms. Evaporation of water (latent heat). Quantification is not provided. Qualitative assessment: High.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates multiple `EnergyDissipationNode`s (Heat, Sound, Viscous Damping, Light Loss) and corresponding `EnergyDissipationEdge`s from relevant energy state nodes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Dissipation mechanisms are inferred from the standard operation of the physical components described (motors, water, projector, computer). The paper acknowledges noise sources (Section 3.2) which often correlate with energy dissipation, but doesn't quantify dissipation itself.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly draws analogy to Maass's Liquid State Machine (LSM), which is described as having "universal analog fading memory." (Section 1). The water wave dynamics serve this role: the current state of the wave pattern (spatial configuration) depends on the recent history of inputs (motor vibrations). Temporal patterns of stimulation are converted to spatio-temporal patterns of waves, allowing a static readout (perceptron applied to a single frame) to classify based on past input history contained within that frame. This constitutes a short-term, fading memory inherent in the physical dynamics.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The analogy to LSM and fading memory is explicit (Section 1). The mechanism (wave patterns encoding temporal history) is explicitly stated ("Temporal patterns of stimulation are converted to spatial patterns of water waves...", Abstract). The persistence beyond stimulus is implicit in the nature of wave propagation and interference, though transient.

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 3
*   Justification: The memory is analog, transient ("fading"), and embodied in the physical state (wave configuration). It's read-only by the external perceptron. It is not actively maintained or easily re-writable in discrete states. Retention is short-term, determined by wave dissipation and boundary conditions. Capacity is related to the high dimensionality of the wave state space but isn't precisely defined or utilized in terms of distinct states. Readout accuracy depends on the perceptron's ability to discriminate patterns. Score reflects presence of fading analog memory but lack of stability, distinct states, or re-writability.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type: `type`: Analog Fading, `medium`: Physical (Water Waves).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The analogy to "analog fading memory" is explicit. The characteristics (transient, embodied, read-only via external system) are inferred from the description of the physical system and the LSM analogy.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: Short-term (Transient)
*    Units: N/A (Qualitative)
*   Justification: The paper refers to "transient internal states" (Section 1) and "fading memory" (Section 1). The memory resides in the propagating and interfering waves, which naturally decay due to viscosity and dissipate over time. The exact timescale depends on water properties, tank size, and input frequency, but is implicitly short (likely on the order of seconds or less, relevant to the frame rate and task dynamics). No quantitative value is given.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: "Transient" and "fading" are explicit terms used. "Short-term" is an interpretation based on these terms and the physics of waves. No quantitative value is provided.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute (`retention_time`: Short-term/Transient) of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: High-dimensional
*   Units: N/A (Qualitative)
*   Justification: The paper leverages the idea from LSMs that the reservoir (water) maps low-dimensional inputs to a "higher dimensional space" (Section 1, implicitly Section 4.1 via complexity). The state space is the configuration of surface waves, captured by the 32x24 grid (768 inputs to the perceptron), representing a high-dimensional state compared to the low-dimensional motor inputs (e.g., 2 bits for XOR). The actual information capacity isn't quantified.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Explicit reference to mapping low-dim input to high-dim space via LSM analogy (Section 1). Implicitly supported by the use of 768 pixel grid inputs to the perceptron (Section 2). No quantitative measure of capacity (e.g., bits, distinct states) is provided.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute (`capacity`: High-dimensional) of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: XOR: 100% (Training), 85% (Test). Speech: 98.5% (Training), ~65% (Test).
*   Units: % Correct Classification
*   Justification: These values represent the accuracy of the *perceptron readout* in classifying the patterns stored transiently in the water waves. Figure 5 shows XOR training/test correctness, Figure 8 shows Speech training/test correctness. Note: This is the accuracy of retrieving/interpreting the memory state for a specific task, not the fidelity of the memory storage itself.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: Accuracy results are explicitly presented in Figures 5 and 8 and discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute (`readout_accuracy_XOR_train`: 1.0, `readout_accuracy_XOR_test`: 0.85, `readout_accuracy_Speech_train`: 0.985, `readout_accuracy_Speech_test`: ~0.65) of `ReadoutEdge` connecting `MemoryNode` to `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A (Qualitatively High/Fast)
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: Memory degradation corresponds to wave dissipation and interference cancelling patterns over time (fading memory). The rate is implicitly high due to the transient nature but not quantified. Noise sources listed in Sec 3.2 (evaporation, vibrations, motor issues) also contribute to degradation/unreliability of the memory state over time.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
            * Justification: Inferred from the "fading memory" description and the physics of wave dissipation. Not explicitly measured.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute (`degradation_rate`: High/Fast) of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Write (Motor Actuation) | N/A | N/A | Joules/bit or W | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Energy cost of writing involves motor activation, not specified. Concept of 'bit' not directly applicable to analog wave generation. |
    | Read (Frame Capture & Perceptron) | N/A | N/A | Joules/bit or W | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Energy cost involves camera, projector, and computer processing, not specified. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: The paper does not discuss or quantify the energy costs associated with memory operations (generating waves or reading them out).

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | Separation Property (Approx.) | Euclidean distance between states vs. distance between inputs (motor count diff.) | Approx. Linear Trend | L2 norm (pixels) vs. Motor count diff. | Attribute of `MemoryNode` | Fig 10 Right | Explicit | Measures how well input differences map to state differences, related to memory distinguishability. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
*   Justification: The approximated separation property is explicitly calculated and plotted in Figure 10, providing a metric related to how well the memory state distinguishes different inputs. Other fidelity/robustness metrics are not provided.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly states water has "inherent self-organising properties such as strong local interactions, time-dependent spread of activation to distant areas" (Abstract). The complex wave interference patterns, which are crucial for computation, emerge spontaneously from the local interactions (wave superposition governed by fluid dynamics) initiated by the motors and boundary conditions. This emergence of complex spatio-temporal patterns from simpler local inputs fits the definition of self-organization. The global patterns are not directly encoded or controlled externally. The complexity analysis (Section 4.1) attempts to quantify properties related to this emergent order.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The term "self-organising properties" is used explicitly in the abstract. The description of wave interference as the computational medium implicitly supports this, as interference is an emergent phenomenon from local wave interactions.

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The local interaction rules are implicitly the principles of fluid dynamics governing wave propagation and superposition on the water surface (approximated by the wave equation under certain conditions, or more generally, Navier-Stokes equations). Key aspects mentioned include: wave interference (constructive and destructive superposition based on phase), wave propagation (spreading activation), reflection from boundaries (tank walls), and damping (viscosity). These physical laws act locally on elements of the fluid, leading to the global wave patterns.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Part of the `AdjunctionEdge` description (local side), representing `LocalInteraction` category edges governed by `rule_type`: FluidDynamics (WaveEquation/Superposition).
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper relies on the reader's understanding of wave physics. It mentions "interference" explicitly but doesn't state the underlying mathematical equations (like the wave equation) which constitute the specific local rules.

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------ | :---------- | :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------: | :----------------: | :------------: |
    | FluidDynamics | Wave propagation/interference | Wave Speed | N/A | m/s | N/A | Implicit | Depends on water depth, gravity, surface tension; not specified. |
    | FluidDynamics | Damping | Viscosity | N/A | Pa·s | N/A | Implicit | Water viscosity determines damping rate; not specified. |
    | FluidDynamics | Boundary Interaction | Reflection Coefficient | N/A | Dimensionless | N/A | Implicit | How waves reflect off tank walls; not specified. |
### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The global order that emerges is the complex, dynamic spatio-temporal pattern of interference waves on the water surface. Specific examples for the XOR task are shown in Figure 3, displaying distinct patterns for different input conditions ([0 0], [1 0], [0 1], [1 1]). For speech, different patterns correspond to "zero" and "one" (Figure 9). This dynamic pattern constitutes the high-dimensional state used for computation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines a `ConfigurationalNode` (`type`: Dynamic Wave Pattern).
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The emergence and use of these wave patterns are explicitly described and visualized (Figures 3, 9).

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: For a given, fixed input condition (like XOR [1 0]), the resulting large-scale wave pattern is relatively stable and predictable (as shown in Fig 3, enabling classification). The system relies on this predictability for the perceptron to learn the mapping. However, the paper acknowledges significant noise and variability (Section 3.2: motor inconsistencies, evaporation, vibrations, variable frame rate), especially affecting speech recognition generalization (Fig 8 Right). This reduces perfect predictability. The separation property analysis (Fig 10 Right) also suggests a somewhat predictable relationship between input distance and state distance.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: Predictability is implied by the successful training results. Lack of perfect predictability is implied by generalization errors and discussion of noise (Section 3.2). The separation property provides a quantitative hint (Explicit).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes to the `AdjunctionEdge` weight mapping local motor inputs to the global `ConfigurationalNode`.

### **4.5. Local Interaction Rules (for Self-Organization)**
* **Vector ID:** M4.5
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Rule ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
| WaveSuperposition_1 | Linear superposition of wave amplitudes at intersecting points | Amplitude, Phase | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Standard wave physics assumed. | N/A |
| WavePropagation_1 | Spread of wave disturbance across water surface | Wave Speed | N/A | m/s | Implicit | Depends on medium properties, assumed constant. | N/A |
| Damping_1 | Decay of wave amplitude over time/distance | Damping Coefficient (related to viscosity) | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Physical property of water assumed. | N/A |
| BoundaryReflection_1 | Wave reflection off tank walls | Reflection Coefficient | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Physical property of boundary interaction assumed. | N/A |

### **4.6. Globally Emergent Order and Order Parameters**
* **Vector ID:** M4.6
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Property ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Protocol | Source |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :------: | :-----: |
| WavePattern_1 | Spatio-temporal interference pattern on water surface | Pixel Values (after processing) | 0-255 (Implied) | Intensity | Explicit | Represents the emergent state read by the camera. | Section 2 | Fig 3, 9 |
| Complexity_1 | Mutual Information based complexity measure (Tononi et al.) | MI(Xj; X-Xj) integrated over subset sizes k | Varies (see Fig 10 Left) | Bits (Information) | Explicit | Quantifies statistical complexity of the patterns. | Section 4.1 | Fig 10 Left |
| StateDistance_1 | Euclidean distance between pixel value vectors for different inputs | L2 norm | Varies (see Fig 10 Right) | Pixel Intensity Units | Explicit | Used to measure separation property. | Section 4.2 | Fig 10 Right |

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | Input-State | Mapping from motor activations (local input) to global wave pattern (state) | Medium-High (See M4.4) | 4 | Separation Property (Approx.), Classification Accuracy | Mixed | The system reliably maps inputs to distinct, classifiable states, but noise affects fidelity. Predictability score (M4.4=7) suggests medium-high fidelity. Yoneda score reflects reasonable but imperfect mapping. Separation property explicitly measured. | Sec 3, Fig 5, 8, 10 |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** 4. Rubric: 0=No relation between local and global; 2=Weak correlation; 4=Discernible mapping, some noise/exceptions; 6=Strong correlation, predictable mapping; 8=Near-perfect functorial mapping; 10=Perfect functorial mapping. The system shows a discernible mapping (input -> wave pattern -> classification), but noise and the limited analysis prevent a higher score. The relationship is primarily demonstrated through task performance rather than a formal functorial analysis.
    *   **Metrics:** Approximate Separation Property (Euclidean distances), Classification Accuracy (XOR, Speech).
    *   **Justification:** The system relies on the local-to-global mapping (motor actions -> global wave state) for its function. The success in classification tasks (especially XOR training) indicates a relatively faithful mapping exists. However, the paper acknowledges noise affecting generalization, and the separation property is only approximated, suggesting the mapping isn't perfectly preserved or understood across all input variations.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The central claim of the paper is that the physical dynamics of the water waves perform a computation, specifically, a non-linear transformation of the input signals into a higher-dimensional space where classification becomes easier (linear separation via perceptron). The water itself is presented as the computing medium ("Liquid State Machine", Abstract; "water undertakes the transformation", Section 1). This transformation is intrinsic to the material's (water's) physical properties (wave dynamics, interference).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Explicitly stated in the abstract ("waves produced on the surface of water can be used as the medium for a 'Liquid State Machine' that pre-processes inputs") and introduction ("water undertakes the transformation").

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Reservoir Computing
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type: Reservoir Computing (Physical Implementation).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *    Justification: The paper explicitly frames the system as a physical realization of a "Liquid State Machine" (LSM), which is a type of Reservoir Computing. (Abstract, Section 1).

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Non-linear spatio-temporal transformation / High-dimensional projection. The fundamental operation performed by the water is the complex, dynamic response to input perturbations, involving wave propagation, superposition (interference), and interaction with boundaries. This transforms the low-dimensional temporal input signal (motor activations over time) into a high-dimensional spatio-temporal state (wave pattern across the surface). This transformation is inherently non-linear due to fluid dynamics and interference effects.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function (`function`: Non-linear Spatio-Temporal Transformation) of the `ComputationNode`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: Explicitly stated as transforming inputs to a higher-dimensional space (Section 1) and pre-processing inputs (Abstract). The non-linear nature is explicit via the XOR result and the analogy to LSMs which rely on non-linearity. The specific mathematical description of the transformation is implicit (governed by fluid dynamics).

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Unit ID | Description | Processing Power | Energy/Operation | Freq/Resp. Time | Bit-Depth | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
| WaterBucket_1 | The entire water body acts as the computational reservoir | N/A | N/A | Wave dynamics timescale (Implicit, seconds?), Camera frame rate (200ms) | Analog (Continuous state space) | Section 1, 2 | Implicit | No metrics for power or energy/operation. Timescales inferred. Analog nature implied by physical medium. |

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Camera Frame Acquisition | 200 | ms | Section 2 | Explicit | Inverse of 5 fps frame rate. |
        | Input Signal (Speech Task Slice) | 500 | ms | Section 2.2 | Explicit | Each of the 8 time slices per word sample drove motors for 0.5s. |
        | Input Signal (XOR Task) | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Motor frequency/duration not specified for XOR. |
        | Wave Propagation/Memory Fading | N/A (Short) | s | N/A | Implicit | Depends on water properties, likely seconds or less. |
        | Perceptron Training Epoch | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Number of epochs given (Fig 4), but time per epoch not specified. |
    *   **Note:** The system operates across multiple timescales, from motor actuation and wave dynamics (likely ms to s) to camera sampling (200ms) and task durations (seconds for speech samples).

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: There is no evidence presented that the water bucket system itself engages in active inference. The water dynamics are physics-driven responses to external perturbations (motors). The system does not appear to possess an internal model of its environment, make predictions about future states, or select actions (motor inputs) to minimize prediction errors. The adaptation/learning occurs externally in the perceptron weights, which minimizes classification error on the *output* of the water dynamics, not prediction error *within* the water dynamics.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The absence of active inference is inferred from the description of the system as a passive physical reservoir being read out by a separate learning algorithm. The paper makes no claims related to prediction, internal models, or surprise minimization within the water itself.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The physical properties of the water and the tank (the computational medium) do not change based on experience or task performance. The wave dynamics are governed by fixed physical laws. The adaptation occurs solely in the weights of the external perceptron readout mechanism, which learns to interpret the wave patterns. The *material system itself* does not exhibit adaptive plasticity.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: Inferred from the description. The paper clearly separates the physical system (water bucket) from the adaptive component (perceptron). It never suggests the water's properties change due to training.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary functional behavior is pattern recognition, specifically: 1. Solving the non-linear XOR problem by classifying input conditions based on resulting wave patterns. 2. Performing speech recognition by discriminating between spoken words ("zero" vs. "one") based on wave patterns generated from pre-processed audio signals. The core emergent behavior enabling this is the system's ability to transform complex temporal inputs into distinct, high-dimensional spatio-temporal patterns (wave interference) that become linearly separable.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` (`type`: Pattern Recognition), with specific instances `BehaviorInstanceNode` (`task`: XOR Classification, `task`: Speech Discrimination).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: The abstract and Sections 2/3 explicitly state the tasks performed (XOR, speech recognition) and show the results.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 5
    *   Justification: The system shows some robustness. It successfully learns XOR despite using incoherent motors (no fixed phase). It performs speech recognition despite significant noise sources explicitly listed (motor variability, water level changes, vibrations, camera frame rate variation, variations in speech samples). However, robustness is limited, as shown by the drop in performance from training to testing, especially for speech recognition (85% XOR generalization, ~65% Speech generalization). The authors state it's "remarkable any classification could be made at all" for speech, suggesting marginal robustness under the experimental conditions.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Robustness to some degree is demonstrated by the successful operation despite noise (explicitly listed in Sec 3.2). Limits to robustness are shown by the generalization gap (explicit results in Figs 5, 8). The score reflects this mixed evidence.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute (`robustness_score`: 5) of the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Validation is primarily through standard machine learning methodology: training and testing sets. For both XOR and Speech tasks, the system (water + perceptron) is trained on one dataset and its performance (classification accuracy) is evaluated on a separate, unseen dataset (Sections 2.1, 3.1, 3.2; Figures 5, 8). The ability to generalize to the test set provides evidence that the emergent wave patterns contain task-relevant information. Control experiments (e.g., attempting classification without the water, directly on raw input) were done for speech (Figure 7 Left), showing significantly worse performance, supporting the water's contribution. The complexity and separation property analyses (Section 4) provide further, indirect validation of the underlying dynamics enabling the behavior. Limitations include the specific noise levels in this setup and the relatively small scale of the tasks.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The use of training/test sets and the presentation of generalization results (Figs 5, 8) are explicit validation methods described. The control experiment for speech is also explicitly shown (Fig 7).

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, there is explicit mapping. The paper directly maps the water bucket system to Wolfgang Maass's Liquid State Machine (LSM) model, which itself is hypothesized as a model for cortical microcolumns (Section 1). The water waves are analogous to the recurrent activity in the LSM's neural network. The transient wave states map to the transient internal states of the LSM. The perceptron readout maps to the linear readout neurons proposed for LSMs. An analogy is also made "between water molecules and neurons in a recurrent neural network" (Abstract). The complexity measure used is drawn from neuroscience (Tononi, Sporns, Edelman) relating to brain complexity (Section 4.1). The speech task is borrowed from Hopfield and Brody's work on cortical sensory integration (Section 2.2). The discussion also relates the work to field computation theories of neural processing (MacLennan, Freeman) (Section 1). Limitations: These are analogies; the water dynamics lack the specific synaptic plasticity and detailed neuronal mechanisms of the brain.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` from `SystemNode` (WaterBucketLSM) to `CognitiveModelNode` (LSM, Cortical Microcolumn, RNN), and from `ComponentNode` (Water Molecule) to `CognitiveComponentNode` (Neuron). Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` from `BehaviorArchetypeNode` (Pattern Recognition) to `CognitiveFunctionNode` (Sensory Processing, Pre-processing).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly draws analogies to LSMs, cortical microcolumns, RNNs, field computation, and uses concepts/tasks from computational neuroscience throughout Sections 1, 2.2, and 4.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity). It uses complex physical dynamics (analogous to neural dynamics in LSMs) for pre-processing/temporal-to-spatial mapping, enabling a simple readout to perform non-linear tasks (XOR, basic speech). This goes beyond simple fixed stimulus-response (Level 1). However, the core "cognitive" aspects like learning/adaptation occur *outside* the physical medium (in the perceptron). The water itself lacks goal-directedness, internal models, planning, or symbolic manipulation associated with higher levels (Level 4+). The memory is transient and passive. While inspired by brain models (LSM), the physical implementation is a very basic analog.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The score is based on comparing the explicitly described system behavior (pattern recognition via physical reservoir) and analogies (LSM) against the provided Cognizance Scale. The justification references specific system features (or lack thereof) relative to the scale levels.

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear
    *   Justification: The paper does not explicitly discuss or test for criticality in the sense of operating near a phase transition, scale-free behavior, or power laws. The complexity measure used (Section 4.1, Fig 10 Left) is related to information integration and differentiation, which can be high in complex systems (including potentially critical ones), but it's not a direct measure of criticality itself. The separation property (Section 4.2, Fig 10 Right) relates to input-state mapping fidelity, relevant for reservoir computing but not directly criticality. While reservoir computers are sometimes hypothesized to work best near "the edge of chaos" (related to criticality), this paper does not investigate this regime.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: Search for terms like "criticality," "phase transition," "power law," "scale-free" yields no results. The analyses performed (complexity, separation) are not standard measures of criticality.

    * Calculation: (M1.2=8 + M2.3=1 + M3.2=3 + M4.1=10 + M4.4=7 + M8.2=5 + M9.2=2) / 7 = 36 / 7 ≈ 5.14. Note: M4.1 (Yes/No) converted to 10 for Yes. Using only numeric scores provided: (8 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 2) / 6 = 26 / 6 = 4.33. *Let's average all quantifiable scores [0-10]: M1.2(8), M2.3(1), M3.2(3), M4.4(7), M8.2(5), M9.2(2). Average = (8+1+3+7+5+2)/6 = 26/6 = 4.33*. Re-evaluating which scores are most relevant per instructions: Modules 1-4 scores (M1.2=8, M2.3=1, M3.2=3, M4.4=7), M8.2=5, M9.2=2. Average = (8+1+3+7+5+2)/6 = 4.33. Let's use the defined average: (M1.2=8, M2.3=1, M3.2=3, M4.1 uses Binary Presence, M4.4=7, M8.2=5, M9.2=2). Let's recalculate using only the numeric scores mentioned: (M1.2=8 + M2.3=1 + M3.2=3 + M4.4=7 + M8.2=5 + M9.2=2) / 6 = 26 / 6 = 4.33. Let's assume M4.1 Yes=10: (8+1+3+10+7+5+2)/7 = 36/7 = 5.14. The instruction says "average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2". M1 has M1.2=8. M2 has M2.3=1. M3 has M3.2=3. M4 has M4.4=7. M8 has M8.2=5. M9 has M9.2=2. Average = (8+1+3+7+5+2)/6 = 4.33. I will use 4.33.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper demonstrates a compelling hybrid system where the physical dynamics of water waves serve as a computational reservoir, analogous to a Liquid State Machine. Its key strength lies in successfully harnessing complex, emergent physical dynamics (wave interference) for non-linear pattern recognition (XOR, speech), effectively mapping low-dimensional temporal inputs to high-dimensional, linearly separable states. The system explicitly embodies computation within the material's physics and possesses a transient, analog memory. However, its CT-GIN readiness is limited. Energy efficiency is extremely low, and the critical memory function is short-term and lacks intrinsic adaptation – plasticity resides solely in the external digital perceptron. While showing some robustness to noise, performance degrades significantly on harder tasks (speech generalization). The cognitive mapping, while explicit (LSM analogy), remains superficial, lacking higher functions like goal-directedness or internal models. Overall, it's a pioneering proof-of-concept for physical reservoir computing (Level 2 Cognizance), but significant advances in material properties (intrinsic memory/plasticity), efficiency, robustness, and theoretical understanding are needed to progress towards genuine material intelligence.

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Quantify Dynamics & Memory:** Systematically measure wave propagation speed, damping rates, and boundary effects. Quantify memory retention time, capacity (e.g., using information theory), and degradation characteristics under varying conditions.
        *   **Energy Efficiency Analysis:** Measure power consumption of components and estimate the energy cost per computation/classification. Explore lower-power alternatives (e.g., different physical media, non-optical readout).
        *   **Enhance Robustness:** Investigate and mitigate sources of noise identified (motors, evaporation, vibrations). Implement feedback control or adaptive filtering if possible.
        *   **Explore Intrinsic Adaptation:** Investigate physical media that exhibit inherent plasticity (e.g., hysteretic materials, self-healing systems, phase-change materials) to integrate learning directly into the reservoir dynamics, moving beyond external readout adaptation.
        *   **Theoretical Modeling:** Develop more detailed mathematical models (beyond analogy) of the water wave computation, predicting performance and guiding design. Analyze the relationship between physical parameters, complexity metrics, separation property, and computational power.
        *   **Scalability Study:** Investigate how performance scales with system size, number of inputs, and task complexity.
        *   **Task Complexity:** Test the system on a wider range of benchmark tasks beyond XOR and simple speech discrimination to better assess its computational capabilities and limitations.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically for "Control Experimentation" could be useful (related to M8.3 but more direct). Was the necessity of the "intelligent" component explicitly tested against a simpler baseline? (Done here for speech, but good to ask directly).
        *   A probe on "Input Encoding": How are real-world inputs translated into the system's native input format? (e.g., speech -> 8x8 matrix -> motor activations). This is crucial context.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Adaptation" (M7) and "Learning" (in M9.3 checklist) could be slightly clarified. M7 focuses on *material* adaptation, while M9.3 seems broader. Explicitly stating M7 = Material/Physical Adaptation vs M9.3 = System-Level Learning (incl. external components) might help.
        *   The scope of "Embodied Computation" (M5.1) in hybrid systems: Clarify if it refers *only* to the physical part or the whole process including digital readout, if the readout is essential for the computation *result*. (Here, water does the transform, perceptron classifies - arguably both are needed for the *final* computation). Template currently leans towards the physical part, which seems correct.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on representing external computational components (like the perceptron) could be clearer. Is it a `ComponentNode` within the `SystemNode`, or an external `ComputationNode` interacting via `ReadoutEdge`? Used `ComponentNode` here.
        *   Mapping adaptation: The template suggests `AdaptationNode` and `Monad` edges for M7.2. When adaptation is *absent* in the material (M7.1=No) but present externally (perceptron), how should the external adaptation be mapped? Adding an optional "External Adaptation" section or clarifying how to map it via interaction edges might be useful.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Calculating M13.1 (CT-GIN Readiness Score): The instruction "Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2" is slightly ambiguous regarding which scores exactly within M1-M4 to use (e.g., M4 has binary M4.1 and score M4.4). Specifying the exact Vector IDs (e.g., M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2) would be clearer. Also clarify how to treat binary (Yes/No) answers if they are intended to be included (e.g., Yes=10, No=0). *Corrected calculation based on clarification during thought process.*
        *   Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on the somewhat subjective Cognizance Scale. Providing more concrete examples for each level *based on material systems* could improve consistency.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Handling qualitative vs. quantitative data for parameters (e.g., Memory Retention). Template allows qualitative, which is good, but maybe add a field for "Basis for Qualitative Assessment" if no number is given.
        *   Optional sections (M3.4-M3.8): Clearly indicating when these are *expected* vs. purely opportunistic would help. (e.g., are they expected if M3.1 is Yes?)
    *   **Overall Usability:** Generally usable, but very detailed. The conditional skipping helps. Explicitly numbering subsections (e.g., ### 1.1 System Description) in the template itself might slightly improve navigation. The strict formatting is crucial but demanding.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Add Vector IDs M1.1.1 for Components list, M1.1.2 Purpose, etc., for finer granularity if needed later.
        *   Consider a dedicated subsection under M5 for "Readout Mechanism" if Embodied Computation requires an external readout, detailing its type and parameters.
        *   For M13.1, list the specific Vector IDs included in the average calculation directly in the instructions.
