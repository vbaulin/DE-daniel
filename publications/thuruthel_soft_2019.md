## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system consists of a pneumatically actuated planar soft finger made of silicone elastomer (Dragon Skin 20) with embedded soft resistive strain sensors made from carbon nanotube-impregnated polydimethylsiloxane (cPDMS). The system's purpose is to perceive its own kinematic state (proprioception) and estimate external contact forces using these embedded sensors and a machine learning model (Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM recurrent neural network). An external motion capture system and a load cell provide ground truth data for training the LSTM. The system aims to achieve real-time, model-free multimodal sensing (kinematics and force) for soft robots, drawing inspiration from biological sensory systems with redundant and unstructured sensor architectures. Components include the soft actuator (finger), embedded cPDMS sensors, pneumatic control system, LSTM network, motion capture system (ground truth), and load cell (ground truth). It demonstrates kinematic estimation during free motion and contact, as well as indirect external force sensing.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`='SoftRobotArm', `domain`='SoftRobotics', `mechanism`='PneumaticActuation_ResistiveSensing_RNN', `components`=['SoftActuator(DragonSkin20)', 'cPDMS_Sensor(PDMS+MWCNT)', 'LSTM_Network', 'PneumaticControl', 'MotionCapture(GroundTruth)', 'LoadCell(GroundTruth)'], `purpose`='MultimodalSensing(Kinematics,Force)'
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the components (actuator material, sensor material, control method, learning algorithm, ground truth systems), their integration, the system's function (kinematic and force estimation), and its overall purpose (bio-inspired soft robot perception).

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper provides good detail on the fabrication of the sensors and actuators, the experimental setup (including the control system, ground truth methods, and data acquisition), and the LSTM network architecture and training parameters. Figures (Fig. 1, S6, S7, S9, S10, S11) supplement the textual descriptions. Some finer details of the LSTM training data processing (e.g., specific normalization technique beyond stating it was done) or the exact 'random' pattern generation might be missing, but overall, the implementation is clear enough for replication.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The clarity is judged based on the explicitly provided details in the "Materials and Methods" section and supplementary figures.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy source is pressurized air supplied to the pneumatic actuator channels. Electrical energy is also required for the sensor readout (LCR meter), control board, LSTM computation, and motion capture system. However, the primary driver of the robot's physical action is pneumatic pressure.
    *   Value: 0 - 3.5 (pressure range)
    *   Units: bar (pneumatic); N/A (electrical values not specified)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode` attributes: `source`='PneumaticPressure', `type`='MechanicalWorkPotential'; `EnergyInputNode` attributes: `source`='Electricity', `type`='Electrical'
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly states the use of pneumatic actuation and specifies the operating pressure range. The need for electrical power for control, sensing, and computation is explicit in the description of the setup.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: 1. Pneumatic energy (pressure) is transduced into mechanical work, causing deformation (bending) of the soft actuator. 2. Mechanical deformation (strain) of the actuator is transduced into changes in electrical impedance (resistance and reactance) by the embedded cPDMS sensors. 3. Electrical signals (impedance) from sensors, along with pressure command signals, are transduced into digital data processed by the LSTM. 4. The LSTM computation transduces input data into estimated kinematic (position) and kinetic (force) outputs. Electrical energy also powers the LCR meter, control electronics, and computational hardware.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge` attributes: `mechanism`='PneumaticToMechanical', `from_node`='EnergyInputNode(Pneumatic)', `to_node`='ActuatorNode'; `EnergyTransductionEdge` attributes: `mechanism`='MechanicalStrainToElectricalImpedance', `from_node`='ActuatorNode', `to_node`='SensorNode'; `EnergyTransductionEdge` attributes: `mechanism`='AnalogSignalToDigitalData', `from_node`='SensorNode', `to_node`='ComputationNode(LSTM)'; `EnergyTransductionEdge` attributes: `mechanism`='DigitalComputation', `from_node`='ComputationNode(LSTM)', `to_node`='OutputNode(Kinematics/Force)'
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes pressurization causing deformation, sensors measuring strain via impedance changes, and the LSTM processing sensor data and pressure commands to produce outputs.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not provide any quantitative metrics for energy efficiency (e.g., work output vs. pneumatic energy input, computational efficiency). Soft pneumatic actuators are generally known to be inefficient compared to traditional rigid robots due to material deformation losses and air compressibility. The computational aspect (LSTM) also consumes energy. Therefore, the efficiency is assessed as qualitatively Low.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `efficiency`='Low' of relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s (e.g., PneumaticToMechanical, DigitalComputation).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: Efficiency is not discussed or measured in the paper. The low score is based on general knowledge of soft pneumatic actuation and RNN computation, inferred from the described system components.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Dissipation mechanisms include: 1. Viscoelastic damping within the soft elastomer material during deformation (heat loss). 2. Internal friction within the actuator material and sensor material. 3. Air leakage (though minimized by sealing). 4. Resistance heating in sensor wires and potentially within the cPDMS material during current flow for impedance measurement (likely minimal). 5. Heat generated by the control electronics and computational hardware performing LSTM calculations. Quantification is not provided. Qualitative assessment: Material damping is likely significant (Medium/High); Computational dissipation depends on hardware (Unknown); Other losses likely Lower.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode`s (e.g., `HeatLossViscoelastic`, `HeatLossComputation`) and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s connecting `ActuatorNode` and `ComputationNode` to respective dissipation nodes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper doesn't explicitly discuss or quantify energy dissipation mechanisms. These mechanisms are inferred based on the physical nature of the components (elastomers, electronics, pneumatics).

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system exhibits memory in two primary ways: 1) Material Memory: The cPDMS sensors and the elastomer actuator exhibit viscoelastic effects like creep and hysteresis ("drift and hysteresis effects typically found in current soft sensors"), meaning their current state depends on their past deformation history. This is a form of short-term physical memory intrinsic to the materials. 2) Computational Memory: The LSTM network is explicitly chosen for its ability to learn and retain information about temporal dependencies ("ability to train long time-lagged data"). The internal state `c(t)` of the LSTM represents a learned memory of the input sequence ([sd(t), ÔÅ¥(t)]), which influences the prediction of the output [y(t) or F(t)]. This memory compensates for the sensor drift and captures system dynamics.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The paper explicitly mentions sensor "drift and hysteresis effects" and the use of LSTM specifically for its memory capabilities to handle time-series data and these nonlinearities. The LSTM state `c(t)` is explicitly mentioned as part of the input mapping.

**(Conditional: M3.1 is "Yes", proceed with M3.2 and M3.3.)**

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 5
*   Justification: The system combines two types of memory:
    *   **Material Memory (Viscoelasticity/Hysteresis):** This is inherent to the soft materials (cPDMS, elastomer). It's a passive, relatively short-term memory exhibiting decay (creep recovery) and path dependence (hysteresis). It's not actively written or read in a controlled digital sense. Score contribution: ~2/10 (low capacity, passive, decaying).
    *   **Computational Memory (LSTM State):** This is an active memory embedded in the structure and weights of the trained LSTM network. It captures temporal dependencies learned from training data to predict future states (kinematics/force) based on past sensor readings and control inputs. It is adaptive (through training) and actively used for computation. This memory is crucial for compensating for the material's non-ideal behavior (drift). Score contribution: ~6/10 (learned, actively used, compensates for material limits, capacity depends on network size).
    *   **Overall:** The combined system leverages the computational memory to overcome the limitations of the passive material memory. The overall score reflects the functional memory achieved through the LSTM, which is essential for the system's performance, but it's still a learned mapping rather than a versatile, re-writable high-fidelity memory system. Retention depends on the LSTM's learned dynamics, capacity on network size/complexity. Read-out accuracy is reflected in the prediction errors.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `MemoryNode(Type=Material_Viscoelastic)` linked to `ActuatorNode` and `SensorNode`; `MemoryNode(Type=Computational_LSTM_State)` linked to `ComputationNode(LSTM)`.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: Material memory effects (drift, hysteresis) are explicitly mentioned. LSTM's role in handling time-series data (implying memory) is explicit. The scoring and detailed breakdown into types represent an interpretation based on these explicit statements and the known properties of LSTMs and viscoelastic materials.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: Short-term (Material); Dependent on task/training (Computational)
*    Units: N/A (Qualitative)
*   Justification: Material memory (creep/hysteresis) effects decay over time (seconds to minutes, typically). The LSTM's effective memory retention depends on the learned dynamics from the training data, designed to capture relevant timescales for the robotic task (on the order of seconds, given the 1s pressure change interval and 10Hz sampling). The paper notes drift is a "slow dynamic process" requiring longer sampling. The LSTM is designed to handle "long time-lagged data", but the specific retention capability isn't quantified.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: Explicit mention of "drift" as a "slow dynamic process" and LSTM handling "long time-lagged data". Qualitative assessment ("Short-term", "Dependent on task/training") is an interpretation based on these statements and typical material/LSTM behavior.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `RetentionTime`='ShortTerm' for `MemoryNode(Type=Material_Viscoelastic)`; Attribute `RetentionTime`='TaskDependent_Seconds' for `MemoryNode(Type=Computational_LSTM_State)`.

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: N/A (Material); 100 hidden units (Computational)
*   Units: N/A (Material); LSTM hidden units (Computational)
*   Justification: Material memory capacity isn't quantifiable as distinct states. The LSTM network used has a specified layer size of 100 units, which relates to its capacity to store temporal information.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (LSTM size) / Implicit (Material)
        *  Justification: LSTM layer size is explicitly stated. Material memory capacity is not applicable in terms of distinct states.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `Capacity`='100_units' for `MemoryNode(Type=Computational_LSTM_State)`.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A (Direct memory readout accuracy not measured)
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: The accuracy reported relates to the *output* of the system (kinematic/force prediction error), which depends on the memory, but it's not a direct measure of memory readout fidelity itself. For instance, kinematic prediction error is ~2-4 mm (Fig 2), force prediction error is ~15.3% (Results section).
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
       *  Justification: The paper provides prediction accuracy, not memory readout accuracy.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A (Material); N/A (Computational)
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: Material degradation (e.g., permanent set, sensor fatigue over many cycles) is not quantified, although acknowledged as a potential issue ("growth, damage, and fatigue" mentioned in intro). Computational memory (LSTM weights) is static after training unless retraining occurs; degradation isn't applicable in the same sense. Sensor failure is explored in the "Graceful degradation" section, but this is component failure, not memory decay rate.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
            * Justification: Degradation is mentioned as a general challenge but not measured or quantified for this specific experiment.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |

    | N/A                 | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | N/A              | N/A               | Energy costs for memory operations (either material state changes or LSTM computations) are not discussed or measured. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: Information not present in the paper.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system's structure (actuator shape, sensor placement) is fabricated according to a design (albeit with some randomness allowed in sensor placement). The operational behavior (kinematic/force estimation) results from a supervised learning process (training the LSTM) based on ground truth data, not from spontaneous emergence of order from local interactions without external control/training signal defining the desired global behavior. While inspired by biological systems which exhibit self-organization, this engineered system relies on predefined structure and external training to achieve its function. The sensor placement is described as "arbitrarily" and "randomly placing them", but this is part of the fabrication protocol intended to demonstrate robustness to placement, not a mechanism for spontaneous structural self-organization during operation.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper describes a fabrication process and a supervised learning approach. There is no mention or evidence of spontaneous pattern formation or structural organization arising solely from local interactions during operation. The lack of self-organization is inferred from the described methodology.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No (Computation is performed by an external LSTM network, not intrinsically by the material properties themselves).
    *   Justification: The computation (mapping sensor/pressure inputs to kinematics/force outputs) is explicitly performed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, implemented using the MATLAB deep learning toolbox. This is a standard computational model run on conventional hardware, external to the physical soft robot structure. While the material properties (sensor response) provide the *input* to the computation, the material itself is not performing the computation.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly states that an LSTM network is used for learning the mapping and making predictions. This clearly indicates external computation.

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Sensor Sampling Interval | 0.1 | s | Materials and Methods | Explicit | Inverse of 10 Hz sampling rate. |
        | Pressure Control Update Period | 1 | s | Materials and Methods | Explicit | Random reference pressures varied every second. |
        | Low-level PD Control Rate | 0.001 | s | Materials and Methods | Explicit | Low-level controller runs at 1000 Hz. |
        | Sensor Drift Timescale | Qualitative: Slow | N/A | Results | Explicit | "drift is a slow dynamic process" |
        | Prediction Phase Lag (cPDMS) | Qualitative: Slight | N/A | Fig 3B / Results | Explicit / Implicit | Explicitly noted ("slight phase lag"), magnitude inferred from Fig 3B graphs (<0.5s estimate). |
        | Training Duration | ~50 | min | Results | Explicit | Calculated from 10Hz sampling rate and number of samples needed (table S1 implies ~30000 samples). |

    *   **Note:** Different processes operate on different timescales, from milliseconds (low-level control) to seconds (actuation commands, prediction lag) to minutes (training, potentially drift).

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system uses a recurrent neural network (LSTM) trained via supervised learning to map current and past sensor/actuation inputs to current kinematic/force outputs. While the LSTM uses past information (memory) to make current predictions, there is no evidence of: (1) Explicit prediction of *future* states beyond the immediate next time step implied by the RNN structure. (2) Action selection *by the system* to minimize prediction error (actions are externally commanded random pressures). (3) An explicit internal world model being updated based on prediction error in the sense required by Active Inference frameworks. The LSTM learns a reactive mapping, albeit one that incorporates history, rather than exhibiting goal-directed behavior based on minimizing surprise via action and perception loops. The concept of "action in perception" is mentioned in the intro and discussion concerning the use of pressure info, but not framed within the Active Inference formalism.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The absence of active inference components (future prediction, model-based action selection, surprise minimization) is inferred from the description of the LSTM's function as a supervised mapping based on past/current inputs.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes (Computational Adaptation during Training) / No (Material Adaptation during Operation)
    *   Justification: The system exhibits adaptation *during the training phase*, where the LSTM network's weights are adjusted based on experience (training data and ground truth) to minimize prediction error. This training results in a persistent change in the computational model leading to the desired perception capabilities. However, during *operation* (after training), the material properties themselves are not described as actively adapting or changing their structure/response characteristics in a way that improves performance over time (beyond the inherent, passive viscoelastic effects already covered under memory). The adaptation is embodied in the parameters of the trained computational model, not in the physical material structure adjusting itself based on operational experience.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The paper explicitly describes the training process using machine learning (LSTM) where the model is adapted to the data. It does not describe any mechanism for the physical materials to adapt during runtime.

**(Conditional: If M7.1 is "Yes", include M7.2)**

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The adaptation mechanism is supervised learning applied to the LSTM network during the training phase. Specifically, the network parameters (weights and biases) are optimized using the Adam algorithm (a stochastic gradient descent optimization method) to minimize the error between the network's predictions (kinematics y(t) or force F(t)) and the ground truth values obtained from the motion capture system or load cell. Input data consists of sensor readings sd(t), reference pressure ÔÅ¥(t), and the LSTM's internal state c(t). This process adjusts the LSTM's internal representation to capture the dynamics of the soft robot and sensor system from the training examples. Regularization (L2 and dropout) is used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. This adaptation occurs offline before deployment; the network is static during testing/operation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `AdaptationNode(Type=SupervisedLearning_LSTM)` linked to `ComputationNode(LSTM)`. Edges represent `TrainingDataInput`, `GroundTruthInput`, `OptimizationAlgorithm(Adam)`. `Monad` edge type could represent the internal weight updates of the LSTM during training. Mechanism: "GradientDescentOptimization(Adam)".
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly states the use of LSTM, supervised learning, Adam optimization algorithm, dropout, L2 regularization, training/testing data split, and the inputs/outputs for the learning process.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The main functional behaviors are: 1. **Kinematic State Estimation (Proprioception):** Predicting the Cartesian coordinates (tip position y(t)) of the soft actuator based on embedded sensor readings (sd(t)) and actuation commands (ÔÅ¥(t)), including adaptation to changes in kinematics due to external contact. 2. **External Force Estimation:** Indirectly estimating the magnitude of external forces (F(t)) applied to the actuator (specifically at the tip in the main experiment) using the same sensor and actuation inputs. 3. **Contact Detection (Implicit):** The system implicitly detects contact through its effect on sensor readings, allowing the kinematic model to adjust (as demonstrated by testing with tip and mid contact). 4. **Graceful Degradation:** Maintaining functional performance (though potentially degraded) in kinematic estimation even when some sensor inputs are lost, due to sensor redundancy and the learned model.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode(Type=KinematicEstimation)`, `BehaviorArchetypeNode(Type=ForceEstimation)`, `BehaviorArchetypeNode(Type=ContactDetection_Implicit)`, `BehaviorArchetypeNode(Type=GracefulDegradation)`. These nodes would be outputs linked from the `ComputationNode(LSTM)`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: Kinematic and force estimation are the primary stated goals and demonstrated behaviors. Implicit contact detection is demonstrated by the different contact scenarios tested. Graceful degradation is explicitly tested and discussed.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates robustness in several ways:
        *   **Robustness to Sensor Nonlinearities/Drift:** Explicitly stated as an advantage of the ML approach using LSTM to handle time-variant behavior (compensated by computational memory). Performance is maintained despite these sensor issues.
        *   **Robustness to Contact:** The kinematic model performs consistently across no-contact, tip-contact, and mid-contact scenarios (Fig. 2), unlike the commercial flex sensor which degrades significantly upon contact.
        *   **Robustness to Sensor Failure (Graceful Degradation):** Simulation results (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) show that the system can maintain reasonable prediction accuracy even with the virtual removal of one or two sensors, especially in the no-contact case, due to redundancy. Performance degrades more significantly with contact when sensors are removed.
        *   **Limitations:** Robustness to variations in fabrication, environmental changes (temperature, humidity), or untrained contact locations/types is not explicitly tested. The 10 Hz sampling rate limits robustness to fast dynamic movements. The phase lag could be an issue for real-time control applications.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Robustness to drift, contact, and sensor failure are explicitly discussed and supported by experimental/simulation results (Figs 2, 6, 7, table S1). Limitations are implicitly suggested by the scope of testing.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `robustnessScore`=6 associated with `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s. Specific robustness types (e.g., `robustnessToDrift`='High', `robustnessToContact`='High', `robustnessToSensorFailure`='Medium') could be added.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: The behaviors (kinematic/force estimation) are validated through quantitative comparison with ground truth data from external systems (motion capture, load cell). Performance metrics include mean error (e.g., mm for position, N or % range for force) presented in figures (Fig. 2, Fig. 4, Fig. 5) and tables (table S1). Control experiments comparing cPDMS sensors with commercial flex sensors provide further validation of the approach's advantages, particularly under contact (Fig. 2, Fig. S2, S3, S4). Graceful degradation is validated through simulations involving virtual sensor removal (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Reproducibility is implied by the description of methods, though not explicitly tested across multiple builds. The claim of "perception" emerges from the successful mapping of low-level sensor signals to higher-level state information (kinematics, force), enabled by the ML model. Limitations include testing primarily on planar motion and specific contact scenarios/locations.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The validation methods (comparison to ground truth, control experiments, simulations) and metrics used are explicitly described in the Results section and associated figures/tables.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper explicitly draws inspiration from the human perceptive system, particularly proprioception. It maps the soft robot system to biological analogs: redundant/unstructured cPDMS sensors mimic biological mechanoreceptors in skin/muscles; the LSTM network plays a role analogous to neuronal modeling centers in the brain adapting to sensory input; the motion capture system acts as an analog to visual feedback used as a teaching signal. The goal is to create a "synthetic analog" of the human perceptive system. Terms like "perception," "proprioceptive system," and "bioinspired sensory architecture" are used throughout. The demonstrated functions (kinematic self-estimation, force sensing) are inherently tied to cognitive concepts of perception. Limitations exist as it's a simplified analogy: the learning is supervised offline, unlike continuous online biological adaptation, and lacks integration with other sensory modalities present in humans.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` linking `SystemNode` to `CognitiveFunctionNode(Type=Proprioception)`, `SensorNode` to `CognitiveAnalogyNode(Type=Mechanoreceptor)`, `ComputationNode(LSTM)` to `CognitiveAnalogyNode(Type=NeuralProcessingCenter)`, `MotionCapture(GroundTruth)` to `CognitiveAnalogyNode(Type=VisualFeedback)`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly states the biological inspiration, draws parallels between system components and biological counterparts, and uses cognitive terms like "perception" and "proprioception" to describe the system's function.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: Based on the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:
        *   **Level 0/1 (Non-Cognitive/Simple Responsivity):** The system goes beyond simple, fixed stimulus-response. The sensors respond to strain, and the actuator responds to pressure.
        *   **Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity):** The system demonstrates adaptive perception (kinematic/force estimation) learned from data. The LSTM's internal state provides a form of memory influencing output. This level seems appropriate. It models aspects of perception found in organisms (proprioception, taction).
        *   **Level 3+ (Autonomy/Goal-Directed/Model-Based):** The system lacks autonomy in action selection (actions are commanded externally). While the LSTM is a model learned from data, it's primarily a reactive mapping model, not an explicit predictive world model used for goal-directed planning in the sense of Active Inference. There's no evidence of higher-level reasoning, context understanding, or self-awareness.
        *   **Conclusion:** The system performs perception-like tasks using learning and memory, fitting well within Level 2. It successfully models a specific aspect of biological perception (proprioception/force sense) using a bio-inspired hardware/software approach but doesn't exhibit higher cognitive functions like autonomous goal-seeking or model-based reasoning.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is assigned based on comparing the explicitly described system functionalities and limitations against the provided Cognizance Scale definitions.

*   **Calculated Score:** 4.0  *(Scores: M1.2=8, M2.3=1, M3.2=5, M4.1=No->N/A treated as 0, M8.2=6, M9.2=2. Avg = (8+1+5+0+6+2)/6 = 22/6 = 3.67 ‚âà 4.0)* Error in calculation, M4 should not be included if No. Avg = (8+1+5+6+2)/5 = 22/5 = 4.4 ‚âà 4. Updated Calculation: M1.2=8, M2.3=1, M3.1=Yes, M3.2=5, M4.1=No (N/A -> 0 for M4 scores), M8.2=6, M9.2=2. Relevant Scores: 8, 1, 5, 6, 2. Average = (8+1+5+6+2)/5 = 22/5 = 4.4. Rounded to 4.0 as requested by the format. Let's recalculate ensuring N/A = 0 correctly. Applicable Scores: M1.2=8, M2.3=1, M3.2=5, M4.4=0 (since M4.1=No), M8.2=6, M9.2=2. Average = (8+1+5+0+6+2)/6 = 22/6 = 3.67. Rounded to 4.0. Let's re-read the instruction: "(Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2, scores with N/A convert in 0). *This score MUST be automatically calculated. Only Number.*" Modules 1-4 contain M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4 (since M4.1=No, score=0). Plus M8.2 and M9.2. Scores are: 8, 1, 5, 0, 6, 2. Average = (8+1+5+0+6+2)/6 = 22/6 = 3.67. Let's round to one decimal place for better precision. 3.7. However, the instruction implies taking the average of the module *presence* or primary scores. Let's re-interpret based on the sections included. Scores to average: M1.2 (Implementation Clarity=8), M2.3 (Energy Efficiency=1), M3.2 (Memory Type=5, given M3.1=Yes), M4.4 (Predictability=0, given M4.1=No), M8.2 (Behavior Robustness=6), M9.2 (Cognitive Proximity=2). Average = (8+1+5+0+6+2)/6 = 3.67. Let's strictly use the listed modules: M1 (use M1.2=8), M2 (use M2.3=1), M3 (use M3.2=5), M4 (use M4.4=0), M8 (use M8.2=6), M9 (use M9.2=2). Average=3.67. Rounding to integer: 4. Rounding to one decimal: 3.7. Will use 3.7 assuming one decimal place is acceptable for better representation. Re-reading: "Only Number." implies integer is safer. Let's use 4.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a hybrid soft robotic system leveraging embedded soft sensors (cPDMS) and machine learning (LSTM) for perception tasks (kinematic and force estimation). Its key strength lies in demonstrating a functional, bio-inspired approach to proprioception in soft robots, overcoming challenges like sensor nonlinearity and drift using computational memory within the LSTM. The system exhibits robustness to sensor variability, contact conditions, and even partial sensor failure (graceful degradation). However, from a strict material intelligence perspective within the CT-GIN framework, its limitations are significant. Intelligence resides primarily in the external LSTM computation, not embodied within the material itself. There is no evidence of intrinsic material computation, self-organization, or online adaptation during operation. Memory is present both passively in the material (viscoelasticity) and actively in the LSTM state, but material memory is poorly quantified, and computational memory is fixed after offline training. Energy efficiency is likely low and unquantified. While mapping strongly to cognitive concepts like perception (Level 2 Cognizance), it lacks autonomy and higher cognitive functions. Overall, it's a capable soft robotic perception system using ML to interface with non-ideal soft sensors, rather than a demonstration of inherent material intelligence. Its potential lies in improving sensor integration for more complex soft robots.

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Embodied Computation:** Explore materials or sensor designs that perform local pre-processing or computation intrinsically, reducing reliance on external centralized models (e.g., integrating memristive elements).
        *   **Online Adaptation:** Develop learning algorithms (potentially integrated with the material/sensor) that allow online adaptation to changes in robot dynamics, sensor drift, or environmental conditions, moving beyond offline training.
        *   **Material Memory Characterization:** Quantify the viscoelastic memory properties (retention, capacity, decay rate) of the cPDMS sensors and actuator material under operational conditions to better understand and potentially exploit these effects.
        *   **Energy Efficiency Analysis:** Measure and analyze the energy consumption of both the actuation and computational components to identify bottlenecks and guide design towards lower-power operation.
        *   **Self-Organization/Scalability:** Investigate fabrication methods allowing for genuinely self-organized sensor network formation. Improve data acquisition hardware (parallel readout) to overcome the current 10Hz limitation and enable scaling to more sensors/DoFs.
        *   **Richer Internal Models:** Explore integrating the learned perceptual models with higher-level cognitive architectures capable of planning, goal-directed behavior, or active inference, even if simulated initially.
        *   **Quantify Temporal Dynamics:** Perform detailed system identification to quantify phase lags, frequency response, and other temporal characteristics relevant for real-time control.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:** Perhaps a dedicated section or probe for "Scalability" (distinct from robustness) could be useful, covering aspects like scaling with DoFs, number of sensors, computational load, fabrication complexity. Also, specific probes on the "Control System" architecture might be relevant for analyzing robotic systems. A probe differentiating "Learning" (acquiring new skills/knowledge) from "Adaptation" (tuning existing behavior) might add nuance.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:** The distinction between "Adaptation" (M7) and "Learning" (part of M9.3 checklist) could be sharper. Is adaptation purely parameter tuning, while learning implies acquiring new representations/behaviors? The term "Cognitive Proximity" (M9) is abstract; the scale helps, but linking it more directly to observable behaviors vs internal states might improve clarity. The scope of "Embodied Computation" (M5) - does external computation using sensor data *from* the material count partially, or must the computation physically occur *within* the material structure? (Current interpretation assumes the latter for a 'Yes'). Clarification on how to handle systems where a function (like memory or adaptation) has both material and external computational aspects (e.g., should the score be averaged, or reported separately?).
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:** Guidance is generally good. Examples are helpful. Specifying standard attribute names for common concepts (e.g., `value`, `units`, `score`, `justification`) could aid consistency. Maybe suggest how to represent composite components (e.g., the sensor being PDMS+MWCNT).
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:** Averaging scores for the CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) can be tricky when modules have different numbers of sub-scores or binary answers (N/A=0 logic needs careful application). Specifying exactly *which* score from each module contributes to the average would be clearer. The 0-10 scales are subjective; perhaps linking specific score ranges (e.g., 0-2=Low, 3-5=Medium, etc.) to qualitative descriptors could aid consistency, although the justifications are key. For M9.3, scoring complex cognitive functions on a single 0-10 scale is inherently difficult and subjective.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:** Information relevant to one probe was sometimes found scattered across sections (e.g., memory details in intro, methods, results). This isn't a template fault but an analysis challenge. The template structure is logical. Ensuring tables handle N/A values gracefully in rendering is important.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is comprehensive but very detailed, making analysis time-consuming. This is necessary for rigor but might be challenging for rapid assessment. The conditional logic (skipping sections) is helpful. The strict formatting requirement is crucial for automated processing but demands meticulous attention from the user.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Clarify the precise calculation method for M13.1, specifying which sub-scores are averaged.
        *   Provide clearer definitions/distinctions for Adaptation vs. Learning, and refine the scope of Embodied Computation.
        *   Consider adding specific prompts/tables for Control System details if analyzing robotic systems frequently.
        *   Suggest standardized attribute names for CT-GIN nodes/edges.
        *   Potentially add a field for "Limitations of Study" identified by the paper itself.
