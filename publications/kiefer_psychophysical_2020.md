*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper describes a theoretical framework proposing an identity between thermodynamic free energy (TFE) A and variational free energy (VFE) F in biological systems, particularly the brain. It explores the implications of VFE minimization (as outlined by the Free Energy Principle - FEP) being implemented directly through TFE minimization. The system *is* the biological entity (e.g., brain) performing variational Bayesian inference. Its components are neurons and their dynamics. Its purpose is to model perception, action, and learning as processes that minimize the discrepancy between an internal generative model and sensory inputs, arguing this minimization corresponds to a physical energy minimization process. This requires a specific type of neuronal encoding, suggested to be a stochastic population code. It connects this idea to mind-brain identity theses and Gestalt psychophysical isomorphism.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Biological (Brain), `domain`: Neuroscience/Cognitive Science/Philosophy, `mechanism`: Variational Inference via Thermodynamic Minimization, `components`: Neurons, Synaptic Connections, Generative Model (encoded), Recognition Model (encoded), Markov Blanket, `purpose`: Perception, Learning, Action, Homeostasis (maintaining non-equilibrium steady state). `ConceptNode` attributes: `conceptType`: Variational Free Energy (VFE), Thermodynamic Free Energy (TFE), Free Energy Principle (FEP), Psychophysical Identity, Stochastic Population Code. `RelationshipEdge` between `SystemNode` and `ConceptNode` (e.g., `implements`, `governedBy`). `RelationshipEdge` between VFE and TFE (`identityProposed`).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The description of VFE minimization, FEP, and the comparison to TFE are explicit. The specific components (neurons) and the proposal of stochastic population codes are explicitly mentioned. The overall system identity (brain implementing VFE via TFE) is the core explicit thesis. Some aspects, like the detailed mechanics of the stochastic code or the exact nature of the generative/recognition models in the brain, are discussed theoretically but not fully specified operationally, making the complete operational description partially implicit based on the referenced theories (e.g., predictive coding).

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework (VFE, TFE, FEP, Bayesian inference) is presented clearly, referencing established concepts and equations (Eq 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2). The core identity thesis is clearly stated. However, the proposed *implementation* mechanism (stochastic population code linking VFE and TFE) is described conceptually (§3.1) but lacks concrete details on how this code would operate physically or how the identity holds precisely across different states (especially far from equilibrium). The connection to specific algorithms like wake-sleep or predictive coding is discussed, but the exact mechanism preferred for the identity thesis is not fully resolved. The description relies heavily on references for the underlying neuroscience and machine learning models.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The score relies on the explicit clarity of the mathematical formalism and the stated thesis, but also on the implicit lack of detailed, operational specifics for the proposed neuronal implementation mechanism that would realize the identity.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Variational Free Energy (VFE or -F) | Eq 2.1 / Eq 2.3 / Eq 3.2 | N/A (Information units, e.g., nats) | Eq 2.1, 2.3, 3.2 | Explicit | High (Theoretical Definition) | N/A |
        | Thermodynamic Free Energy (A or F(T)) | F(T)=〈E(T)〉−TS | Joules (J) | Sec 2.1 | Explicit | High (Theoretical Definition) | N/A |
        | Temperature (T) | Assumed T=1 for VFE-TFE analogy; biological range for actual TFE | Kelvin (K) or Dimensionless (for analogy) | Sec 2.1, Sec 2.3 | Mixed | Medium (Analogy value explicit, biological value implicit) | Value T=1 used explicitly for formal analogy, biological T is implicit context. |
        | Generative Density P(v,z) or P(v,h) | Probability Density Function | N/A (Probability units) | Eq 2.1, Sec 2.1 | Explicit | High (Theoretical Concept) | N/A |
        | Recognition Density Q(z|v) | Probability Density Function | N/A (Probability units) | Eq 2.1, Sec 2.1 | Explicit | High (Theoretical Concept) | N/A |

    *   **Note:** The paper is theoretical. Parameters listed are key concepts defined mathematically. VFE has units related to information (like nats or bits, though often treated as dimensionless energy in analogies), while TFE has physical energy units. The T=1 assumption is specific to simplifying the VFE-TFE *formal analogy*.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: For the biological system (e.g., brain) considered, the ultimate energy input is metabolic (e.g., glucose, ATP). The paper also discusses sensory inputs perturbing the system from steady state, which can be seen as informational "energy" in the VFE context or physical energy perturbing the TFE state. The paper focuses more on the internal energy dynamics related to VFE/TFE minimization rather than the primary metabolic source.
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A (Metabolic: Joules; Sensory/Informational: context-dependent)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Metabolic, Sensory Perturbation, `type`: Chemical, Physical/Informational.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper assumes a biological system operating thermodynamically, which implicitly requires metabolic energy input to maintain non-equilibrium steady state (§2.4), but this is not the focus or explicitly detailed. Sensory inputs perturbing the system are mentioned (§1, §2.1).

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: The core thesis involves the transduction between information processing (VFE minimization) and physical processes (TFE minimization). Sensory input (physical energy/information) perturbs the system. This perturbation increases VFE. The system then acts (physically, requiring metabolic energy) or updates its internal model (physically, requiring metabolic energy for neuronal activity) to minimize VFE. The paper argues this VFE minimization *is* a process of TFE minimization (§3.2, §4.1), implying a transduction where informational "potential" (surprise, prediction error) is converted into physical work/state change driven by thermodynamic potentials. The paper discusses how internal energy U (potential and kinetic energy of neuronal states) and entropy S contribute to TFE (A = U - TS) and how these relate to VFE components (expected energy under Q and entropy of Q) (§2.1, Eq 2.3, §2.2, §2.3). Specifically, it relates the energy term E(v,z) = -log P(v,z) in VFE to the physical potential energy driving neuronal dynamics under the identity thesis.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: `mechanism`: VFE-TFE Identity, Bayesian Inference via Physical Dynamics, Stochastic Population Coding, `from_node`: SensoryInputNode/PerturbationNode, `to_node`: NeuronalStateNode/SystemConfigurationNode. `RelationshipEdge` between VFE and TFE nodes (`identityProposed`). `ComponentNode` (e.g., Neuron) internal edges representing energy transformation linked to information processing.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The formal relationship between VFE and TFE components (Eq 2.3) is explicit. The proposed identity (VFE = A) is explicit (§4.1). The link between the VFE energy term E(v,z) and physical potential energy is explicitly argued (§2.2). However, the precise physical mechanisms of how neuronal activity performs VFE computations while simultaneously minimizing TFE via the proposed stochastic code are discussed theoretically but not fully operationalized, making the transduction mechanism partially implicit.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A (The paper discusses efficiency conceptually but provides no metrics).
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper argues that minimizing VFE is computationally/statistically efficient and proposes this corresponds to thermodynamic efficiency ("statistical and thermodynamic efficiency go hand-in-hand", §3.2). It mentions minimizing energy expenditure as a goal for material computation in the context of the background field (§2.3 discussion on Helmholtz free energy, §3.2 discussion on belief updates). However, no quantitative measure of the efficiency of the proposed brain mechanism is provided. The link to metabolic efficiency is mentioned via reference [45].
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `efficiency` (Qualitative: High/Assumed High) of `EnergyTransductionEdge` (VFE-TFE Identity).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
      *  Justification: The *claim* of efficiency linkage is explicit (§3.2, quoting [9]). The *lack* of quantitative metrics within this paper is explicit. Reference [45] is cited for detailed treatment of metabolic efficiency, implying the paper views the process as efficient but doesn't quantify it itself.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: The paper mentions heat dissipation implicitly in the context of thermodynamic free energy (A = U - TS, where TS relates to heat) and non-equilibrium steady states (§2.1, §2.3, §2.4). It references Parr et al. [18] regarding the relationship between heat dissipated and surprisal/changes in free energy (§3.2, footnote 16). Maintaining non-equilibrium steady state requires ongoing energy input to counter dissipation to the environment (§2.4). However, specific mechanisms or quantitative values for energy dissipation in the brain related to VFE minimization are not provided within this paper.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyDissipationNode`: `type`: Heat. `EnergyDissipationEdge` from `SystemConfigurationNode` to `EnvironmentNode`, `mechanism`: Irreversible Processes, Entropy Production. Attribute related to T*S term in TFE definition.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The concept of dissipation is explicitly present through the definition of TFE and discussion of steady states/irreversibility (§2.1, §2.4, §3.2 fn16). The reference to heat is explicit. Lack of quantification within *this* paper is explicit.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The framework discussed (variational inference, FEP) explicitly involves learning, which requires changes to the system's internal state (parameters of the generative model, θ) based on past experience (sensory data, v) that persist and influence future inferences and behavior. This constitutes memory. The generative model itself represents prior knowledge or beliefs, which is a form of memory (§1, §2.1, §3.2 on learning reducing divergence). Hopfield networks, mentioned as an influence, are memory storage systems (§2.2).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The paper explicitly discusses unsupervised learning (§1), the updating of generative model parameters based on data (§2.1, Eq 2.2 explanation), and relates the framework to memory systems like Hopfield networks (§2.2). Learning inherently implies memory.

**(Conditional: M3.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M3.2 and M3.3.)**

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 8
*   Justification: The memory described is embedded within the parameters (θ) of the generative model P(v,z) or P(v,h), which are learned/updated over time (§2.1, §3.2). This represents long-term storage of statistical regularities of the environment. It's implicitly re-writable through learning/ VFE minimization. The capacity could be very high, depending on the complexity of the model. Read-out occurs during inference when the model is used to predict causes (h) or data (v). The description aligns well with concepts of learned representations and priors in computational neuroscience and machine learning, suggesting a high-fidelity, adaptable memory system. The score reflects the theoretical capacity and adaptability, though physical limitations aren't detailed.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type: `storageMechanism`: Model Parameters (θ), `location`: Generative Model, `updateMechanism`: VFE Minimization / Learning.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The existence of learned parameters in the generative model is explicit (§2.1). The interpretation of these parameters as encoding memory of environmental statistics is explicit in the context of FEP/variational inference literature referenced. The precise mechanisms, capacity, and read-out fidelity within the proposed VFE-TFE identity framework are implicitly assumed based on the theoretical models, rather than detailed operationally.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: Long-term
*    Units: Qualitative Descriptor
*   Justification: The memory is encoded in the parameters of the generative model, which changes through learning over the organism's lifetime (§1, §2.1). This implies long-term retention, characteristic of learned knowledge and priors, rather than short-term working memory. The paper discusses learning on ontogenetic and phylogenetic timescales (§2.4).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The paper discusses learning over lifetimes and evolutionary timescales, implying long-term memory. However, it doesn't explicitly state "long-term retention time" or provide a quantitative value. This is inferred from the nature of unsupervised learning and generative model updates discussed.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute `retentionTime`: Long-term of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: N/A (High implied)
*   Units: N/A (e.g., number of parameters, bits)
*   Justification: The paper doesn't quantify memory capacity. However, the hierarchical generative models discussed in the context (e.g., deep learning, predictive coding) typically have very high capacity, determined by the number and configuration of their parameters (neurons, synapses).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Inferred from the types of models discussed (hierarchical generative models). Not explicitly stated or quantified in the paper.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `capacity` (Qualitative: High) of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A (e.g., %, error rate)
*   Justification: The paper discusses the use of the generative model for inference and prediction, which constitutes memory readout. The accuracy of this readout is related to the VFE (specifically the accuracy term in Eq 3.2). Minimizing VFE aims to maximize accuracy, but no specific metric for readout accuracy is provided.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
       *  Justification: Inferred from the function of the generative model in inference and the goal of VFE minimization. Not explicitly quantified.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Related to the `accuracy` term in VFE formulation (Eq 3.2) and the minimization process represented by `VFE_MinimizationEdge`.

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: Memory degradation (forgetting) is not discussed in the paper.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
            * Justification: Topic not addressed.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Learning (Write)    | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | Implicitly [45]   | Implicit          | Paper implies energy cost via TFE link, references [45], but provides no values. |
    | Inference (Read)    | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | Implicitly [45]   | Implicit          | Paper implies energy cost via TFE link, references [45], but provides no values. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: The paper links VFE minimization (including learning/inference) to TFE minimization, implying an energy cost. It cites [45] for metabolic efficiency. However, it does not quantify the energy cost of memory operations itself.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table

    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |

    | N/A       | N/A         | N/A    | N/A   | N/A             | N/A          | N/A               | Fidelity and robustness metrics are not discussed. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
*   Justification: Topic not addressed.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper situates itself within the context of unsupervised learning in neural networks (§1) and the FEP applied to life generally (§1, §2.4). These frameworks often describe how complex adaptive structures and functional organization (like generative models) emerge from local interactions (neuronal activity, synaptic plasticity) driven by principles like VFE minimization, without explicit external programming of the final structure. The paper explicitly mentions Hopfield networks exhibiting "spontaneously emerging self-organizational properties" (§2.2) and cites works on self-organization in response to environmental pressures ([44], §2.4). The emergence of non-equilibrium steady states is also framed as a self-organizing process (§2.4).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Explicit mentions of self-organization in related models (Hopfield nets, §2.2) and broader context (§1, §2.4 citing [44], §3.2 citing [59]). The link between VFE minimization and the *emergence* of specific brain structures/models is implied by the FEP literature referenced, but the detailed mechanism of emergence isn't the primary focus of *this* paper's core argument about VFE-TFE identity.

**(Conditional: M4.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M4.2-M4.7)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The paper doesn't specify the *exact* local interaction rules but alludes to several possibilities based on the models discussed:
        1.  **Hopfield-like Dynamics:** Neurons update state based on weighted inputs from connected neurons to minimize a global energy function (§2.2). Rule: Update state `s_i` based on `sum(w_ij * s_j)`.
        2.  **Predictive Coding:** Neurons representing predictions interact with neurons representing prediction errors based on top-down (generative) and bottom-up (recognition) connections (§3.1, citing [5, 25]). Rules involve passing prediction errors up and predictions down, adjusting states to minimize error (VFE).
        3.  **Stochastic Population Code Dynamics:** Probability of neuronal firing related to membrane potential via sigmoid function (§2.2, citing [31]), potentially following Boltzmann distribution (Eq 2.4) under specific conditions (§2.2, §3.1). Interaction rules would involve synaptic weighting and integration leading to stochastic firing.
        4.  **Wake-Sleep Algorithm Dynamics:** Units' activities driven by recognition weights (bottom-up) or generative weights (top-down) depending on algorithm phase (§3.1).
        The paper argues for a stochastic encoding (§3.1) where the *thermodynamic* interactions (leading to TFE minimization) *are* the *computational* interactions (VFE minimization).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Part of the `AdjunctionEdge` description (local side). Defines "LocalInteraction" edge types like `SynapticInputIntegration`, `ErrorPropagation`, `PredictionGeneration`, `StochasticFiring`.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly mentions the models (Hopfield, Predictive Coding, Wake-Sleep) and concepts (Boltzmann distribution, sigmoid activation) that *contain* specific local rules. However, it doesn't explicitly write out the definitive set of rules for the system realizing the VFE=A identity, instead discussing possibilities and requirements (like stochasticity).

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

    | Rule ID                  | Description                               | Parameter Name          | Parameter Value Range | Units          | Data Source                             | Implicit/Explicit | Justification                                           |
    | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |

    | Temperature (Boltzmann)  | Scales energy term in probability         | T                       | N/A                   | K or Dimensionless | Eq 2.4, §2.1, §2.3                      | Explicit          | Defined in Boltzmann distribution & TFE; value varies. |
    | Learning Rate            | Rate of change of model parameters (θ)  | η (implied)             | N/A                   | N/A            | §1, §2.1, §3.2 (Learning context)         | Implicit          | Learning is central, but rate parameter not mentioned. |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The emergent global order discussed is the formation of an effective internal generative model of the environment, encoded in the system's structure (e.g., synaptic weights) and dynamics. This allows the system to maintain non-equilibrium steady state (homeostasis) and perform accurate perception and action by minimizing VFE (§1, §2.4). Another form of order is the system settling into low-energy states corresponding to coherent interpretations or memories (as in Hopfield nets, §2.2). The paper also mentions the system approaches non-equilibrium steady state via TFE minimization ([9], §1).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines a `ConfigurationalNode`: `type`: GenerativeModelRepresentation, NonEquilibriumSteadyState, AttractorState (Memory). Defines a `SystemStateNode`: `type`: LowVFE, LowTFE.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: Non-equilibrium steady state and VFE minimization are explicit goals/outcomes discussed. The idea that the generative model *emerges* is explicit in the context of unsupervised learning (§1). The specific structure of this emerged model or the steady state is described conceptually rather than structurally detailed.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A (Predictability not discussed in these terms)
    *   Justification: The paper focuses on the *principles* driving the system towards certain states (VFE/TFE minimization, steady state) rather than the predictability of reaching a specific configuration. While the process is framed as a gradient descent (§1), factors like stochasticity (§3.1) and complexity make the exact final state potentially unpredictable, although the *type* of state (low VFE/TFE) is predicted by the theory. No quantitative measures of predictability are provided.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: N/A
    *  Justification: Concept not directly addressed.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** N/A

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The core thesis is that the physical dynamics of the brain (minimizing TFE) *are* the computations involved in variational Bayesian inference (minimizing VFE). This is the definition of embodied computation – the computation is intrinsic to the physical system's behavior, not performed by a separate controller referencing the physical state. "the mathematics of variational inference delineates a set of formal relations that obtain within a system whether it is described cognitively... or purely physically" (§1).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly argues for the identity of computational (VFE) and physical (TFE) processes, which entails embodied computation (§1, §3, §4.1).

**(Conditional: M5.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Neuromorphic / Stochastic / Analog / Bayesian Inference Engine
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type: `computationClass`: Neuromorphic, Stochastic, Analog, Bayesian Inference.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *    Justification: The system described is the brain, involving neurons, making it "Neuromorphic". The paper argues for a "Stochastic Population Code" (§intro, §3.1). The underlying neuronal dynamics (membrane potentials, firing rates) are analog. The overarching computation performed is "Bayesian Inference" (specifically, variational inference, §1, §2.1).

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: The fundamental computation is **Variational Bayesian Inference**, aiming to approximate a posterior distribution P(z|v) by optimizing an approximate distribution Q(z|v) to minimize VFE (or maximize negative VFE, F). This involves calculating expectations under Q, evaluating probabilities under P, calculating entropy of Q (see Eq 2.1, 2.3, 3.2). At a lower level, this relies on neuronal operations like:
        *   **Weighted Summation:** Integrating synaptic inputs (implied by neuronal models like Hopfield, §2.2).
        *   **Non-linear Activation:** Applying a sigmoid function or similar to determine firing probability (§2.2).
        *   **Stochastic Sampling:** Generating activity according to a probability distribution (Boltzmann or otherwise, §3.1).
        *   **Error Calculation:** Comparing predictions and actual inputs (in predictive coding context, §3.1).
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** Bayesian Inference (Variational Approximation)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode`: `function`: VariationalInference. Lower-level operations map to functions of `NeuronNode` or `SynapseEdge`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: Variational inference is explicitly the core computation (§1, §2.1). The underlying neuronal primitives (summation, activation, sampling, error calculation) are explicitly mentioned in the context of related models (§2.2, §3.1) and are implicitly necessary components for implementing the overall inference process neurologically.

    *   **Note:** The paper discusses processes occurring across a vast range of timescales, from fast neural dynamics to evolutionary adaptation, but provides no specific values.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper is explicitly framed within the Free Energy Principle (FEP) (§1), which *is* a theory of active inference. It describes systems minimizing VFE (prediction error/surprise) through both perception (updating internal models/recognition density Q, §2.1) and action (changing the world/sensory input v to fit the model, §1, §3.2, footnote 14). This involves internal generative models P used for prediction (§2.1), updates based on minimizing the difference between prediction and reality (VFE minimization, §1, Eq 2.2), and action selection implicitly aimed at confirming predictions (making sensory data fit the generative model/prior, §1, §2.1, footnote 14).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly identifies its framework with the FEP (§1) and discusses VFE minimization driving both model updates (perception/learning) and interactions with the environment (action) (§1, §2.1) which are the core components of active inference. Footnote 14 explicitly links action to modifying accuracy.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:**
        *   **Prediction Error Reduction Rate:** (`MetricNode` attribute) Quantify the rate of change of VFE or KL divergence (Eq 2.2) over time during a task. CT-GIN: Track `VFE` attribute of `SystemStateNode` over `TemporalEvolutionEdge`.
        *   **Model Update Magnitude:** (`MetricNode` attribute) Measure the change in parameters (θ) of the `GenerativeModelNode` per unit time or per prediction error signal. CT-GIN: Track attributes of `GenerativeModelNode` linked via `AdaptationEdge`.
        *   **Action Selection ProbabilityBias:** (`MetricNode` attribute) Measure the probability of selecting actions that lead to sensory inputs predicted by the generative model (high P(v|h)). CT-GIN: Analyze transition probabilities between `ActionNode`s conditional on `SystemStateNode` (representing expected VFE).
        *   **Anticipation Timescale:** (`MetricNode` attribute) Measure how far into the future the system's actions seem to be planned based on minimizing predicted VFE. CT-GIN: Analyze sequences of `ActionNode` selections using temporal graph algorithms.

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: Adaptation is central. The paper discusses unsupervised learning (§1) where the generative model is iteratively refined based on sensory data. This involves changing the model parameters (θ) to better predict inputs, thus reducing VFE over time (§1, §2.1, §3.2). This change persists and alters future behavior/inference. The FEP framework explicitly covers learning and adaptation on multiple timescales (§1, §2.4).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: Unsupervised learning (§1), iterative refinement of the generative model (§1, §2.1), parameter updates (§2.1, context of Eq 2.2), and minimization of VFE over ontogenetic/phylogenetic time (§2.4) are all explicit descriptions of adaptive plasticity.

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M7.2)**

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary mechanism described is **Variational Free Energy (VFE) Minimization** via gradient descent (§1). The system adjusts its internal parameters (θ, representing synaptic weights or similar in the brain) to minimize the difference between its predictions (from the generative model P) and the actual sensory data (represented via the recognition density Q). This minimizes KL divergence (Eq 2.2) and maximizes model evidence (or a lower bound on it). Specific algorithms mentioned as potential implementations include:
        *   **Wake-Sleep Algorithm:** Alternating phases update generative and recognition models (§3.1).
        *   **Predictive Coding:** Hierarchical message passing minimizes prediction error (§3.1).
        *   **Expectation-Maximization (E-M):** Iterative estimation of hidden states (E-step, inference via Q) and model parameters (M-step, updating P) (§2.4 footnote, §3.2).
        The paper argues this process is physically realized by the system minimizing its thermodynamic free energy (§3.2). The learning rule adjusts parameters θ to minimize VFE, effectively performing Bayesian inference/learning. E.g., `Δθ ∝ -∂VFE/∂θ`.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `AdaptationNode` type: `mechanism`: VFE_Minimization, GradientDescent. `AlgorithmNode` connected to `AdaptationNode` (e.g., `WakeSleep`, `PredictiveCoding`, `EM`). `Monad` edges represent the update process acting on the `GenerativeModelNode`. Edge attribute `learningRule`: VFE_Gradient.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: VFE minimization via gradient descent is explicitly stated (§1). Specific algorithms (Wake-Sleep, Predictive Coding, E-M) are explicitly mentioned as related implementations (§2.4, §3.1, §3.2). The precise mathematical form of the gradient update rule (`Δθ ∝ -∂VFE/∂θ`) is implied by gradient descent on VFE but not written out explicitly.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary functional behaviors resulting from the described framework (FEP/VFE minimization) are:
        1.  **Perception:** Inferring the hidden causes (H or z) of sensory data (v) by optimizing the recognition density Q(z|v) (§1, §2.1).
        2.  **Learning:** Updating the parameters (θ) of the internal generative model P(v,z) to better account for experienced sensory data (§1, §2.1).
        3.  **Action:** Interacting with the environment to selectively sample sensory data that confirms the generative model's predictions (i.e., minimize prediction error/VFE) (§1, §2.1, footnote 14).
        4.  **Homeostasis / Self-Maintenance:** Maintaining the organism's physiological states within viable bounds (phenotypic states), framed as staying close to non-equilibrium steady state by minimizing surprisal/VFE (§1, §2.4).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: `Perception`, `Learning`, `Action`, `Homeostasis`. These nodes are outcomes of the `VFE_Minimization` process acting on the `SystemNode`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: Perception, learning, action, and self-maintenance (life in general) are explicitly described as outcomes or applications of the VFE minimization framework (§1, §2.1, §2.4).

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper does not explicitly discuss or quantify the robustness of these behaviors (perception, learning, action) to noise, perturbations, or system damage within the VFE=A framework. While biological systems exhibiting these behaviors are generally robust, and the FEP itself is argued to confer robustness by minimizing surprise, this paper doesn't provide evidence or metrics for it.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: Robustness is not addressed in the paper.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: N/A. The paper is theoretical. It presents a framework and argues for its plausibility based on existing theories (FEP, Bayesian brain, thermodynamics, philosophy of mind) and mathematical formalism. It cites empirical work related to FEP and neuroscience but does not present new experimental validation of the core VFE=A identity thesis or the emergent behaviors specifically under this identity. The primary validation is theoretical coherence and consistency with related frameworks. Potential validation would require experimental measurement of both neuronal dynamics/TFE and VFE correlates during cognitive tasks. The paper mentions a key test is the empirical plausibility of the required stochastic code (§conclusion).
     *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: Paper is theoretical; no empirical validation presented within the text.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, the entire paper is about mapping cognitive processes to physical processes. It explicitly maps:
        *   **Variational Bayesian Inference (a cognitive/computational theory):** Directly identified with thermodynamic free energy minimization (a physical process) (§1, §4.1, VFE=A thesis).
        *   **Mental States (e.g., beliefs, perceptions):** Hypothesized to be identical to brain states (§1, §4.1), specifically those involved in representing the generative and recognition densities. The content of these states (what they represent) is linked to their functional role in the inference process (§4.1, footnote 19, citing [52]).
        *   **Perception/Learning/Action (cognitive functions):** Explained as consequences of VFE minimization (§1, §2.1).
        *   **Subjective Perceptual Experience:** Linked via Gestalt psychophysical isomorphism to underlying physiological correlates (§1), suggesting structural similarity between phenomenal experience and brain activity governed by VFE/TFE.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` connecting: `ComputationNode` (VariationalInference) to `PhysicalProcessNode` (TFE_Minimization); `CognitiveStateNode` (Belief, Perception) to `NeuronalStateNode`; `BehaviorArchetypeNode` (Perception, Learning) to `VFE_Minimization` process; `PhenomenalExperienceNode` to `NeuronalStateNode` (via `isomorphism`).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper's central theme is the psychophysical identity, explicitly mapping cognitive/computational descriptions (VFE, mental states) to physical descriptions (TFE, brain states) and referencing historical mappings (identity theory, Gestalt).

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 4
    *   Justification: The paper directly addresses goal-directed behavior (minimizing VFE as the goal) based on internal models (generative model P). This aligns with Level 4. It uses variational inference, a model-based reasoning approach. Learning/adaptation is central. Sensing/perception is the input to the process. It strongly argues for an identity between these computational/cognitive functions and physical brain processes. However, it focuses on the *formalism* and *philosophical identity* rather than demonstrating specific high-level cognitive abilities like planning, relational reasoning, abstract thought, or social cognition (Levels 5-7+). While the FEP framework *can* be extended to these areas, this paper's core VFE=A identity thesis is presented at the level of basic inference, learning, perception, and action grounded in physics. It establishes a strong theoretical link at Level 4 but doesn't provide evidence or detailed mechanisms for higher levels within its scope.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The score is based on the explicit framework discussed (VFE, generative models, goal-directedness via minimization) aligning with Level 4 criteria. The justification for *not* scoring higher comes from the explicit scope of the paper, which doesn't delve into the mechanisms needed for Levels 5+.

**CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:** (Provided for reference, score justified above)
*   Level 0: Non-Cognitive
*   Level 1: Simple Responsivity
*   Level 2: Sub-Organismal Responsivity
*   Level 3: Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy
*   **Level 4: Goal-Directed/Model-Based Cognition**
*   Level 5: Contextual/Relational Cognition
*   Level 6: Abstract/Symbolic Cognition
*   Level 7: Social Cognition
*   Level 8: Metacognition/Self-Awareness

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear
    *   Justification: The paper discusses systems operating at **non-equilibrium steady states** (§1, §2.4). While some theories link NESS or phase transitions near them to criticality, this paper does *not* explicitly claim that the VFE=A identity requires or implies operation *at* a critical point (in the sense of power laws, scale invariance, etc.). It focuses on the approach *to* NESS via free energy minimization. The connection between FEP/VFE and criticality is debated in the broader literature but isn't a claim made or evidenced within this paper.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A (Lack of claims or evidence for criticality in the text).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *    Justification: The paper makes no claims about criticality.

## M11: Review Paper Specifics (Conditional)

    *   Content: N/A

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

**(Activated as paper type is Theoretical/Computational)**

*   **Vector ID:** M12
*   **Vector Type:** Theory

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper demonstrates strong theoretical rigor. It clearly defines the core concepts (VFE, TFE) using standard mathematical formulations (Eqs 2.1-2.4, 3.2). It builds a logical argument connecting VFE minimization (from cognitive science/ML) to TFE minimization (from physics) via the FEP. Assumptions (e.g., need for stochastic code) are stated (§3.1). It connects the thesis to historical philosophical arguments (identity theory, Gestalt isomorphism) (§1, §4.1). It acknowledges potential issues (e.g., VFE as ensemble property vs. state property, §3.1) and proposes solutions (stochastic encoding). It appropriately cites relevant literature ([1-13] for FEP, [14, 15] for philosophy, [18, 19, 45] for related work). The argument is internally consistent and logically developed. Potential weakness lies in the lack of concrete operationalization of the proposed stochastic code.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
       *  Justification: The use of equations, logical structure, and citations supporting rigor are explicit. The assessment of overall soundness is an inferred judgment based on these explicit elements.

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The theory is proposed for biological systems (brains), which obviously exist. The core challenge lies in experimentally *verifying* the proposed VFE=A identity and the necessity of the specific stochastic encoding mechanism. Measuring thermodynamic free energy and variational free energy concurrently in a behaving brain is extremely difficult. The proposed stochastic encoding (§3.1) based on models like Boltzmann machines or wake-sleep has biological plausibility issues (e.g., wake-sleep phases, §3.2), though the paper suggests modifications related to predictive coding (§3.2). The potential depends heavily on developing experimental techniques to test the core identity claim and finding empirical evidence for the required type of neural code. It's physically plausible in principle (brains obey thermodynamics, perform computation), but validation is a major hurdle.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The system (brain) exists (explicit). The challenges in measurement and the plausibility issues of specific mentioned codes are explicitly or implicitly acknowledged (§3.1, §3.2, §conclusion). The score reflects the gap between theoretical plausibility and experimental tractability.

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: If experimentally validated, the theory provides a fundamental bridge between information processing/cognition and physics/thermodynamics. This unification is highly significant. For CT-GIN, it suggests that categories describing computational processes (VFE minimization, Bayesian inference) could be directly mapped to categories describing physical processes (TFE minimization, neuronal dynamics) via an identity functor, potentially simplifying models of cognizant systems. It highlights key constraints (stochastic encoding) required for such an identity. It offers a path to potentially derive cognitive dynamics from physical laws under certain conditions. The potential impact on understanding biological cognition and inspiring bio-mimetic AI/materials is high, aligning well with the goals of understanding embodied intelligence through frameworks like CT-GIN. The score is tempered by the current lack of empirical validation.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *   Justification: The potential impact is inferred from the nature of the proposed identity. The alignment with CT-GIN goals (linking computation and physics) is implicit. The explicit mention of testable constraints (§conclusion) supports its potential to guide research.

## M13: Overall Assessment & Scoring

*   **Vector ID:** M13
*   **Vector Type:** Overall

### **13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   **Calculated Score:** 4.25 (Average of M1.2=6, M2.3=0 (N/A), M3.2=8, M4.1=Yes (treated as 10 for calc?), M4.4=0 (N/A), M8.2=0 (N/A), M9.2=4. Let's re-evaluate which scores apply. Applicable numeric scores: M1.2 (Clarity=6), M3.2 (Memory Type=8), M9.2 (Cognitive Proximity=4). M2.3, M4.4, M8.2 are N/A -> 0. Average = (6+0+8+0+0+4)/6 = 18/6 = 3.0. If we include M12.1 (Rigor=8), M12.2 (Realization=6), M12.3 (Potential=7), this becomes more complex depending on how theoretical scores integrate. Let's stick to the core M1-M9 scores that are quantifiable/scorable even if N/A maps to 0. (6+0+8+0+0+4)/6 = 3.0). Let's refine: M4.1 is Yes, not a score. M4.4 is N/A. Let's use M1.2=6, M2.3=N/A(0), M3.2=8, M4.4=N/A(0), M5.1=Yes, M5.2/M5.3=Descriptive, M7.1=Yes, M8.2=N/A(0), M9.2=4. Average of rated scores (M1.2, M3.2, M9.2) = (6+8+4)/3 = 6.0. Average including N/A as 0 (M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2) = (6+0+8+0+0+4)/6 = 3.0. Let's use the average of *available* scores from the specified list: M1.2=6, M3.2=8, M8.2=N/A (skip), M9.2=4. Average = (6+8+4)/3 = 6.0. Recalculating based on the template instruction "Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2, scores with N/A convert in 0". Applicable scores: M1.2=6, M2.3=0, M3.2=8, M4.4=0, M8.2=0, M9.2=4. Average = (6+0+8+0+0+4) / 6 = 18 / 6 = 3.0)
*   **Calculated Score:** 3.0

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This theoretical paper proposes a profound identity between variational free energy (VFE), a cornerstone of computational theories of brain function (FEP, Bayesian Brain), and thermodynamic free energy (TFE). Its key strength lies in its conceptual boldness and rigorous grounding in both statistical physics and information theory, seeking to unify cognitive/computational descriptions with physical laws. It explicitly addresses embodied computation, adaptation/learning, memory (via generative models), and goal-directed behavior through the lens of VFE minimization being equivalent to TFE minimization. The primary limitation for CT-GIN analysis is its purely theoretical nature concerning a biological system (brain), lacking specification or analysis of a concrete, implementable *material* system. Crucial details about the proposed implementing mechanism (stochastic neural code) are underspecified, and the VFE=A identity remains empirically unverified. While conceptually rich for understanding potential physical bases of cognition (Cognitive Proximity Score: 4), its direct applicability to designing or analyzing *engineered* cognizant matter is currently low (CT-GIN Readiness Score: 3.0). Its main contribution is providing a high-level theoretical target: can systems be built where information processing efficiency *is* thermodynamic efficiency?

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Operationalize Stochastic Code:** Develop a concrete, physically plausible model of the stochastic neural code required for the VFE=A identity, specifying local interaction rules and parameters.
        *   **Experimental Validation Design:** Propose specific experiments (potentially using simplified model systems like neuromorphic hardware or engineered molecular systems) capable of simultaneously measuring VFE correlates and TFE dynamics to test the identity thesis.
        *   **Quantify Energy Costs:** Extend the theory to explicitly model the thermodynamic costs (dissipation, work) associated with specific computational steps (inference, learning) under the VFE=A assumption, moving beyond analogy.
        *   **Explore Material Realizations:** Investigate potential non-biological material systems (e.g., neuromorphic analogue circuits, active matter systems with memory) where a similar VFE-TFE identity might be engineered or observed.
        *   **Connect to CT Formalisms:** Explicitly formulate the proposed relationships (e.g., VFE=A, local-to-global dynamics, learning) using Category Theory to clarify mappings and structural preservation (or lack thereof).
        *   **Analyze Robustness:** Theoretically analyze the robustness of systems governed by the VFE=A principle to noise and perturbations.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically addressing the **level of abstraction** might be useful for theoretical papers (e.g., "Is the system described a specific instance, a class of systems, or a purely abstract principle?").
        *   For theoretical work proposing identities (like VFE=A), a probe on the **nature of the proposed identity** (e.g., "Is the identity claimed to be formal/mathematical, approximate, causal, or strict ontological identity?") could be helpful.
        *   A probe on **testability/falsifiability** directly asking how the central claims could be tested or falsified, especially for theoretical papers (partially covered in M12.2 and M8.3, but could be more direct).
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Self-Organization" (M4) and "Emergent Behaviors" (M8) could be slightly clearer. Self-organization focuses on pattern formation from local rules, while emergence focuses on the global functional behaviors. Perhaps clarifying M8's focus on *functional* emergence vs. M4's structural/pattern emergence.
        *   The mapping of N/A scores to 0 for the readiness score calculation (M13.1) might disproportionately penalize papers that simply don't address certain aspects, versus those that address them poorly. A different aggregation method might be considered (e.g., averaging only available scores, but noting coverage). However, the current method does reflect how much information relevant to the template is *present*.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on mapping *processes* (like VFE minimization) vs. *states* (like NESS) could be slightly more explicit. Currently mapped as `ProcessNode` and `StateNode`, which seems adequate.
        *   Representing the *strength* or *nature* of a proposed relationship (e.g., `identityProposed` vs. `correlatesWith` vs. `causes`) might need more standardized edge types or attributes.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Assigning scores for a purely theoretical paper to categories designed for physical systems (e.g., M2: Energy Flow, M8.2 Robustness) is inherently difficult and often results in N/A or low scores based on lack of applicability, as noted above for M13.1. Maybe conditional scaling based on paper type?
        *   The Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on interpreting the paper against the provided scale, which can be subjective. More concrete examples linked to specific scale levels within the rubric might help consistency.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Extracting information for M4 (Self-Organization) from a paper not explicitly focused on it required inference based on context (e.g., unsupervised learning implies emergence).
        *   Mapping the philosophical arguments (e.g., identity theory) onto the CT-GIN framework was abstract but manageable via `CognitiveMappingEdge`.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very comprehensive and detailed. Its strictness ensures consistency but makes application to papers outside the core domain of *engineered* material intelligence challenging, requiring significant interpretation or yielding many "N/A" fields. This is acceptable if the goal is to precisely benchmark against this specific framework. The structure is logical.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Consider adding a "Scope/Level of Abstraction" field in M1 to immediately contextualize theoretical vs. experimental work.
        *   Refine the calculation method or interpretation instructions for the CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) for theoretical papers where many physical metrics are N/A.
        *   Add definitions or examples to the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale (M9.2) clarifying the jump between levels, especially 3-4-5.
