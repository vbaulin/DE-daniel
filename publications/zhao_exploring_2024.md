__Paper Type:__ Review

## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: This paper reviews the concept of embodied intelligence (EI) within the context of soft robotics. It explores how EI, which emphasizes the synergy of brain, body, and environment, applies to soft robots whose behaviors inherently depend on their physical forms, material properties, and interaction with the environment. The review covers research branches including embodied morphological computation, embodied artificial evolution, and perception, control, and decision-making in soft robotics. It summarizes research progress and discusses related scientific problems, aiming to provide a reference for future work. Key components discussed include soft robot bodies (morphology, materials like soft silicone, hydrogels, SMAs, liquid metals), sensors, actuators, control systems (including RL, CPGs), and the environment itself as an interactive component. The purpose is to synthesize the current understanding and advancements in EI for soft robotics.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Review, `domain`: Soft Robotics / Embodied Intelligence, `mechanism`: Literature Review/Synthesis, `components`: [Embodied Morphology, AI Evolution, Perception, Control, Decision-Making, Soft Materials, Sensors, Actuators, Environment], `purpose`: Review current state, identify trends/gaps in EI for soft robotics.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The abstract and introduction explicitly state the paper's scope, purpose, components discussed (EI concepts, soft robotic elements), and the domain.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The review clearly outlines its methodology (Section 2), including search strategy, keywords, databases, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and data extraction process (PRISMA diagram). It explicitly defines the different types of intelligence discussed (Table 1) and structures the review logically (Sections 3, 4, 5). The specific areas reviewed (morphological computation, evolution, perception/control/decision-making) are clearly delineated. Clarity could be slightly improved by more detailed quantitative synthesis across studies, but the overall structure and process are well-defined.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: Section 2 explicitly details the review methodology, and the paper structure is explicitly laid out in the introduction. Table 1 explicitly defines terms.

*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: N/A (The review discusses various soft robot systems but does not focus on the energy input for a specific system in detail. Energy is mentioned abstractly, e.g., "energy storage and conversion for efficient movement" (Sec 4.1 intro), "symbiotically share energy" (Sec 4.3 para 5)).
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: The paper is a review and does not specify energy input details for a singular system.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: N/A (While mechanisms like SMA actuation (Fig 4a) or motor-driven fin rays (Fig 8) imply energy transduction (e.g., electrical to thermal/mechanical, electrical to mechanical), the review does not detail the transduction processes or efficiencies across the systems discussed). Morphological computation (Sec 4.2) implies transduction from physical deformation/dynamics to computational states, but this is discussed conceptually.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Energy transduction is implicit in the description of actuated soft robots (e.g., SMAs, motors, pneumatic systems mentioned), but the review doesn't focus on analyzing these processes.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: N/A (The review mentions "efficient movement" (Sec 4.1 intro) and "energy efficiency" (Sec 5) as goals or challenges but does not provide quantitative efficiency data or comparative analysis for the systems reviewed).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: Efficiency is mentioned as a concept/goal but not quantified or analyzed across the reviewed literature.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: N/A (Mechanisms like friction or material hysteresis are inherent in soft robotics, but the review does not analyze or quantify energy dissipation mechanisms for the discussed systems).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: Dissipation is not discussed.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes (Implicitly, through discussion of learning and adaptation)
    *   Justification: The review discusses reinforcement learning (RL) (e.g., Sec 4.3, 4.4.2, 4.4.3), evolutionary algorithms leading to adapted morphologies/controllers (Sec 4.3), and morphological computation (Sec 4.2, mentioning reservoir computing). These processes inherently involve storing information (e.g., controller parameters, learned policies, reservoir states) that influences future behavior based on past interactions/training. The Baldwin effect mentioned (Sec 4.3) explicitly links learning (memory of successful behaviors) to evolutionary adaptation.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The concept of memory is implied by the discussion of learning, adaptation, evolution, and computation methods (RL, RC), but the term "memory" itself is not explicitly analyzed as a core component across all systems reviewed.

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: N/A
*   Justification: The review covers various systems employing different mechanisms that imply memory (e.g., learned parameters in RL controllers, evolved morphologies, dynamic states in reservoir computing). It does not provide enough detail to assess the fidelity (retention, capacity, accuracy) of memory for any specific system or comparatively across systems. Assigning a single score would be inappropriate for a review covering diverse approaches.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: `MemoryNode` (types could include `LearnedPolicy`, `EvolvedMorphology`, `ReservoirState`)
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    * Justification: The review mentions concepts implying memory but doesn't analyze memory properties directly.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*    Units: N/A (Qualitative Descriptor: Varies - potentially Short-term (e.g., dynamic reservoir states) to Long-term (e.g., evolved morphologies, trained RL policies))
*   Justification: Retention time depends heavily on the specific mechanism (e.g., stability of evolved structure, persistence of trained network weights, decay time of physical reservoir states). The review does not provide specific data.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The review discusses mechanisms that imply varying retention times, but does not quantify them.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute of `MemoryNode`

       *  Justification: N/A
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: N/A (The review does not discuss memory degradation).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
            * Justification: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |

    | N/A                 | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | N/A               | N/A               | N/A                 |
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: Energy cost of memory operations is not discussed.

*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
*   Justification: Memory fidelity/robustness are not discussed.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The review discusses embodied artificial evolution (Sec 4.3), where morphologies and controllers co-evolve without explicit design of the final form. It also mentions self-organizing multicellular organisms (Dictyostelium) as inspiration for multi-robot organisms that dynamically aggregate and self-assemble (Fig 7). Morphological computation (Sec 4.2), especially reservoir computing using physical bodies, relies on emergent dynamics from complex, often randomly initialized systems (the reservoir). These examples point to processes where global order or functional behavior emerges from local interactions and evolutionary/learning dynamics, not solely from top-down design.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Section 4.3 explicitly discusses co-evolution and self-assembly inspired by organisms like Dictyostelium (Fig 7). Section 4.2 discusses reservoir computing which relies on emergent dynamics.

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The review mentions several contexts where local rules lead to global outcomes:
        *   **Evolutionary Algorithms (Sec 4.3):** Local rules are embodied in the genetic representation (encoding morphology and/or controller) and the selection criteria (fitness function based on task performance in an environment). The interaction is mutation/crossover operators acting locally on the genotype, and selection acting based on global performance resulting from the phenotype's interaction with the environment. Example: DERL framework [42], CPG evolution with morphology [44].
        *   **Morphological Computation (Reservoir Computing, Sec 4.2):** Local rules are the physical dynamics governing the interactions within the soft body (the reservoir), e.g., mass-spring dynamics [35] or fluid dynamics in pneumatic systems [37]. The input signal perturbs these local dynamics.
        *   **Multi-Robot Organisms (Sec 4.3):** Inspired by Dictyostelium, local rules involve emitting/sensing signaling molecules (e.g., cAMP) leading to chemotaxis and aggregation [46, 47]. Robots dock based on local attraction/connection rules.
        *   **Reinforcement Learning (Sec 4.4.2):** Local rules may exist within the controller (e.g., neural network activations), but the primary "interaction" is the agent-environment loop (state -> action -> reward -> state update), which involves global state observation (often) and reward signals.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `AdjunctionEdge` (description: physics simulation rules, evolutionary operators, RL update rules, chemotaxis signal response). `LocalInteraction` edge category defined by these rules.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: The review explicitly mentions concepts like evolutionary algorithms, reservoir computing, and Dictyostelium chemotaxis, which rely on local rules. However, the specific mathematical or algorithmic form of these rules for the cited examples is often implicit (requiring reference to the original papers like [35, 42, 44, 46, 47]).

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------ | :---------- | :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------: | :----------------: | :------------: |
    | N/A     | N/A         | N/A            | N/A         | N/A   | N/A          | N/A                | N/A            |
    *Justification:* The review doesn't quantify parameters governing local interactions.

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The review describes several types of emergent global order:
        *   **Evolved Morphologies/Gaits (Sec 4.3):** Complex robot shapes and coordinated movement patterns (e.g., trotting, galloping, rolling gaits, Fig 6) emerge from evolutionary processes optimizing for task performance (e.g., locomotion).
        *   **Aggregated Structures (Sec 4.3):** Multi-robot organism formation (inspired by slime mold fruiting bodies, Fig 7).
        *   **Learned Control Policies (Sec 4.4.2):** Complex, adaptive behaviors (e.g., grasping [52], swimming [54], manipulation [51, 53]) emerge from RL training.
        *   **Computational States (Sec 4.2):** Higher-dimensional dynamic representations suitable for processing time-series data emerge within the physical reservoir.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `ConfigurationalNode` (types: `EvolvedMorphology`, `LearnedGait`, `AggregatedStructure`, `LearnedPolicy`, `ReservoirStateRepresentation`).
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: Examples of emergent gaits (Fig 6), aggregated structures (Fig 7), learned behaviors (grasping, swimming), and the concept of higher-dimensional representations in RC are explicitly discussed and shown.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification: The review does not assess the predictability of the emergent global order. Evolutionary and learning processes often have stochastic elements, making perfect prediction difficult, but the review doesn't quantify this.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: N/A
    *  Justification: Predictability is not discussed.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **4.5. Local Interaction Rules (for Self-Organization)**
* **Vector ID:** M4.5
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Rule ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
*Justification:* The review doesn't quantify parameters governing local interactions for self-organization.

### **4.6. Globally Emergent Order and Order Parameters**
* **Vector ID:** M4.6
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Property ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Protocol | Source |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :------: | :-----: |
| Locomotion | Gait Type (e.g., trot, gallop) | N/A | Categorical | N/A | Explicit | Fig 6 caption describes observed gaits. | Observation/Simulation | Fig 6 [44] |
| Locomotion | Task Success (e.g., reaching target) | N/A | Binary/Percentage | N/A | Explicit | RL papers cited often report success rates. [54] aims for target reach. | Simulation/Experiment | e.g., [54] |
| Aggregation | Formation of Aggregate | N/A | Binary | N/A | Explicit | Fig 7 shows aggregation. | Observation/Simulation | Fig 7 [46, 47] |
*Justification:* The review describes emergent outcomes qualitatively or via figures, but doesn't define or quantify specific order parameters systematically across studies.

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** N/A
    *   **Justification:** Category Theoretic concepts like the Yoneda Lemma are not discussed in the review.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The review explicitly discusses "Embodied Morphological Computing" (Section 4.2). It defines morphological computation as utilizing complex morphological features for perception, control, and computation, citing examples like reservoir computing using soft structures [36] or body dynamics for perception [38]. Physical intelligence encoding "computation" into the robot's body is also mentioned (Table 1).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Section 4.2 is dedicated to this topic, defining and providing examples. Table 1 also mentions computation within the body.

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Reservoir Computing, Analog (implicitly)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `ComputationNode` (type: `ReservoirComputing`, `MorphologicalComputation`, potentially `AnalogComputation`)
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *    Justification: Reservoir Computing is explicitly mentioned and described as a key example in Section 4.2 [34, 36]. The reliance on physical dynamics (e.g., mass-spring networks [35], tentacle dynamics [36], pneumatic arm dynamics [37]) suggests an underlying analog computational process, though the term "analog" isn't explicitly used in this computational context.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Nonlinear transformation/mapping (inherent in Reservoir Computing). Reservoir computing's function is to transform input data into higher-dimensional dynamic representations, enhancing nonlinear characteristics (Sec 4.2, para 2). This is the core primitive enabling subsequent linear readout for tasks. Other examples imply primitives like Signal Integration (body dynamics for perception [38]) or potentially basic filtering/feature extraction through physical interaction.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `ComputationNode` function: `NonlinearMapping`, `StateSpaceExpansion`, `SignalIntegration`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: Section 4.2 explicitly states the function of the reservoir is to transform inputs into higher-dimensional dynamic representations to enhance nonlinearity.

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Unit ID | Description | Processing Power | Energy/Operation | Freq/Resp. Time | Bit-Depth | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
*Justification:* The review does not provide quantitative details on the performance or characteristics of specific embodied computational units.

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Evolutionary Timescale | N/A (many generations) | Generations | Sec 4.3 | Implicit | Evolution is inherently multi-generational. |
        | Learning Timescale (RL) | N/A (training steps/episodes) | Steps/Episodes | Sec 4.4.2 | Implicit | RL requires iterative training. |
        | Response Timescale (Sensing/Control) | N/A (Implied: real-time) | ms to s | Sec 4.4.1, 4.4.2 | Implicit | Control loops and sensing (e.g., 60 fps camera in Fig 8) imply real-time operation. |
        | Reservoir Dynamics Timescale | N/A | N/A | Sec 4.2 | N/A | Not specified. |
        | Slime Mold Aggregation Timescale | N/A | Hours/Days | Sec 4.3 [46] | Inferred | Biological process timescale inferred from context [46]. |
    *   **Note:** The review discusses processes occurring over vastly different timescales, from fast control loops to slow evolutionary adaptation. Specific values are generally not provided.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear
    *   Justification: The review does not explicitly mention "Active Inference." While RL agents (discussed in 4.4.2, 4.4.3) select actions to optimize future rewards (related to minimizing prediction errors about value functions), and morphological computation/evolution implicitly encode environmental models, the specific framework and principles of Active Inference (prediction error minimization based on a generative model) are not discussed or evaluated in the reviewed systems.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: Active Inference is not mentioned.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The review extensively discusses adaptation mechanisms:
        *   **Evolutionary Adaptation (Sec 4.3):** Robot morphology and controllers adapt over generations to improve fitness in specific environments [41, 42, 43, 44]. The Baldwin effect explicitly links learned adaptations to evolutionary change [42].
        *   **Learning-Based Adaptation (Sec 4.4.2, 4.4.3):** Reinforcement learning enables robots to adapt their control strategies through interaction with the environment to achieve tasks like grasping [52], locomotion [54], manipulation [51, 53], or human-robot collaboration [62].
        *   **Morphological Adaptation (Implicit in Sec 4.2, 4.3):** The physical form itself adapts (through evolution or potentially dynamic morphing [31, 32]) to better suit tasks or environments. Self-repair capabilities [21, 31, 32] also represent a form of structural adaptation.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: Sections 4.3 (Evolution), 4.4.2/4.4.3 (RL Control/Decision Making), and mentions of self-repair/morphing explicitly describe adaptive processes where behavior/structure changes over time based on experience or selection pressures.

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary mechanisms discussed are:
        *   **Evolutionary Algorithms (Sec 4.3):** Adaptation occurs through selection based on fitness, combined with variation operators (mutation, crossover) acting on genetic representations of morphology and/or controllers. Examples include Genetic Reinforcement Learning (GRL) [41] and DERL combining evolution with DRL [42]. Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) controlled by evolutionary algorithms are also used [44].
        *   **Reinforcement Learning (Sec 4.4.2, 4.4.3):** Agents learn optimal policies (mapping states to actions) by trial-and-error interaction with the environment, guided by reward signals. Algorithms mentioned or implied include Deep RL (DRL) [42, 51, 61], Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) [51], and model-free methods like ELFNet (based on Q-networks) [53]. Fusion with simulation (e.g., FEM) is also used [52]. Adaptation occurs via updating policy/value function parameters (e.g., neural network weights).
        *   **Morphological Computation (Sec 4.2):** Adaptation is less about changing structure and more about leveraging existing physical dynamics for computation/control. However, the *readout* layer in Reservoir Computing is trained (adapted).
        *   **Self-Assembly/Self-Repair (Sec 4.1, 4.3):** Mechanisms involve dynamic aggregation based on local signals [46, 47] or intrinsic material properties enabling dynamic morphing/repair [21, 31, 32].
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `AdaptationNode` (types: `EvolutionaryAlgorithm`, `ReinforcementLearning`, `SelfAssembly`, `SelfRepair`). `Monad` edges representing the update/selection process. Adaptation mechanisms specified as attributes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Sections 4.3 and 4.4 explicitly describe Evolutionary Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning as adaptation mechanisms, citing specific approaches and papers [41, 42, 44, 51, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62]. Self-assembly/repair are also explicitly mentioned [21, 31, 32, 46, 47].

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The review describes a wide range of functional behaviors resulting from embodied intelligence in soft robotics:
        *   **Locomotion:** Swimming (fish-like [26, 54], jellyfish-like [28], turtle-like [25]), trotting, galloping, rolling (evolved creatures [44]), general movement in complex environments.
        *   **Manipulation:** Grasping [52], object manipulation [42, 51, 53], agile maneuvers [61].
        *   **Perception:** Sensing environmental stimuli (non-contact, contact, shape, material, roughness) [48, 49], object localization using body dynamics [38].
        *   **Computation/Information Processing:** Nonlinear mapping (Reservoir Computing) [34, 36].
        *   **Adaptation/Learning:** Acquiring new skills/gaits through evolution [42, 44] or RL [51, 52, 53, 54].
        *   **Collective Behavior:** Aggregation, self-assembly (Multi-robot organisms) [46, 47].
        *   **Self-Maintenance:** Self-repair [21, 31, 32].
        *   **Navigation/Exploration:** Autonomous mapping and exploration [60], reaching targets [54].
        *   **Human-Robot Interaction:** Air-gesture teaching [48], adaptive collaborative assembly [62].
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `BehaviorArchetypeNode` (types: `Locomotion`, `Manipulation`, `Perception`, `Computation`, `Adaptation`, `CollectiveBehavior`, `SelfMaintenance`, `Navigation`, `HRI`).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors are explicitly described and often illustrated (e.g., Fig 4, 6, 7, 8) or cited throughout Sections 4.1-4.4.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification: Robustness is mentioned as a desirable quality ("enhance robustness", Table 1; "system's robustness", Sec 3) and a challenge (Sec 5), but the review does not provide quantitative assessments or comparative analysis of the robustness of the behaviors discussed in the cited literature. It's implied that soft bodies offer inherent compliance/robustness to physical interaction, but this is not measured.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Robustness is mentioned as a concept/goal but not measured or analyzed.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Reliability attributes of `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: The review indicates validation primarily through:
         *   **Simulation:** Many studies involving evolution [42, 44] and RL [52, 55-59] rely heavily on simulation environments (e.g., SofaGym, Elastica, MuJoCo implied in [42]). Fig 6 explicitly shows simulated evolved robots.
         *   **Physical Experiments:** Some studies demonstrate behaviors in real robots, e.g., multimodal sensing [48, 49], swimming robot target reaching [54] (Fig 8 indicates experimental setup), soft arm control [51], octopus-inspired arm interaction [29]. Fig 4 shows various physical bio-inspired robots [24, 25, 26]. Morphological computation is validated via physical systems like pneumatic arms [37] or octopus arms [36].
         *   **Performance Metrics:** Validation often involves measuring task success rates (e.g., grasping success, target reaching accuracy [54], object identification accuracy [49]), efficiency, or comparing learned/evolved behaviors to baselines.
         *   **Limitations:** The review notes the challenge of the reality gap between simulation and physical experiments (implicit). It doesn't systematically analyze the rigor of validation across all studies.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *   Justification: The review explicitly mentions simulation environments [55-59] and shows figures of both simulated [Fig 6, Fig 8b simulation aspect] and physical robots/experiments [Fig 4, Fig 5c, Fig 8a, Fig 7b physical robots]. The use of performance metrics is explicit in some cited examples [49, 54]. The limitations are implicit based on general knowledge of the field.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The review maps system functionalities to cognitive concepts primarily through the framework of "embodied intelligence," contrasting it with other forms like computational, physical, perceptual, and cognitive intelligence (Table 1, Fig 3). Specific cognitive concepts mentioned include: perception, learning, decision-making, reasoning (cognitive intelligence definition, Table 1), understanding, thinking (also cognitive intelligence). Embodied intelligence itself is presented as integrating perception, learning, decision-making, and action, surpassing mere physical movement and emphasizing interaction with the environment. Concepts like the Baldwin effect [42] explicitly link learning (a cognitive process) to evolution. Autonomous decision-making is discussed as a goal akin to human cognition (Sec 4.4.3).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `CognitiveMappingEdge` linking `BehaviorArchetypeNode` (e.g., Adaptation, Navigation, Manipulation) to `CognitiveFunctionNode` (e.g., Learning, DecisionMaking, Perception, Planning).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper's core theme is mapping embodied intelligence concepts onto soft robotics. Table 1 explicitly defines different intelligences including cognitive aspects. Sections 4.3, 4.4 explicitly discuss learning, perception, decision-making.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification: The systems reviewed primarily demonstrate Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy (Level 3). They clearly show adaptation of behavior (locomotion gaits, control policies) through learning (RL) and evolution within specific task contexts. Perception and action are tightly coupled. However, the review provides limited evidence for behaviors requiring internal models for goal-directed planning (Level 4), understanding complex relationships (Level 5), or abstract reasoning (Level 6). While "decision-making" and "planning" are mentioned (e.g., path planning algorithms [64]), the examples focus more on adaptive control and learned responses rather than deep, model-based reasoning or foresight. The discussion remains largely focused on achieving robust, adaptive behaviors through interaction, fitting well within Level 3.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The score is based on interpreting the explicitly described behaviors (learning, adaptation, perception-action loops) according to the provided Cognizance Scale. The lack of evidence for higher levels is implicitly inferred from the review's focus.

**CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:**

*   **Level 0: Non-Cognitive:** Purely reactive system.  No internal state beyond immediate stimulus-response.
*   **Level 1: Simple Responsivity:** Basic stimulus-response behavior.  Reactions are fixed and predetermined.
*   **Level 2: Sub-Organismal Responsivity:**  Behavior exhibits basic forms of adaptation or plasticity, but lacks complex representation or goal-directedness.
*   **Level 3: Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy:** System adapts its behavior based on experience and feedback, but within a limited behavioral repertoire.
*   **Level 4: Goal-Directed/Model-Based Cognition:** System exhibits goal-directed behavior based on internal models of the world, allowing for planning and flexible action selection.
*   **Level 5: Contextual/Relational Cognition:** System understands and responds to relationships between objects, events, and concepts.
*   **Level 6: Abstract/Symbolic Cognition:** System can manipulate abstract concepts and symbols, enabling logical reasoning and problem-solving.
*   **Level 7: Social Cognition:** System exhibits social intelligence, understanding and interacting with other agents.
*   **Level 8: Metacognition/Self-Awareness:** System possesses awareness of its own internal states and cognitive processes.
*   **Level 9: Phenomenal Consciousness:**  System exhibits subjective experience (qualia). (Currently theoretical for material systems)
*   **Level 10: Sapience/Self-Reflective Consciousness:** System possesses self-awareness, understanding of its own existence, and ability for complex abstract thought. (Currently theoretical for material systems)

### **9.3 Cognitive Function Checklist**

    | Sensing/Perception               | 6           | Explicitly discussed (Sec 4.4.1, multimodal sensors, body dynamics for perception). Advanced biological mimicry attempted. | `BehaviorArchetypeNode: Perception` -> `CognitiveFunctionNode: Perception` | Explicit | Discussed with examples [38, 48, 49]. |
    | Memory (Short-Term/Working)        | 3           | Implicit in RL state representations and RC dynamics. Not explicitly analyzed for duration/capacity. | `AdaptationNode` / `ComputationNode` attributes | Implicit | Implied by methods used (RL, RC). |
    | Memory (Long-Term)                 | 4           | Implicit in trained RL policies and evolved structures/controllers. Persistence demonstrated but mechanisms/limits unclear. | `AdaptationNode` attributes, `MemoryNode` | Implicit | Implied by persistence of learned/evolved outcomes. |
    | Learning/Adaptation              | 7           | Major focus (Sec 4.3, 4.4.2). RL & Evolution examples show significant adaptation for specific tasks. | `BehaviorArchetypeNode: Adaptation` -> `CognitiveFunctionNode: Learning` | Explicit | Core theme with many examples [41-44, 51-54]. |
    | Decision-Making/Planning          | 4           | Discussed (Sec 4.4.3). RL policies make action decisions. Path planning mentioned [64]. Focus seems more reactive/learned than deliberative planning. | `BehaviorArchetypeNode: Navigation` -> `CognitiveFunctionNode: DecisionMaking` | Mixed | Explicitly discussed, but examples lean towards learned policies rather than complex planning. |
    | Communication/Social Interaction | 2           | Limited mention (multi-robot aggregation signals [46, 47], HRI [48, 62]). Not a primary focus. | `BehaviorArchetypeNode: CollectiveBehavior`, `HRI` | Explicit | Mentioned briefly with examples. |
    | Goal-Directed Behavior            | 5           | Implicit in task-based RL (e.g., reaching target [54], grasping [52]) and evolutionary fitness goals. | `BehaviorArchetypeNode: Navigation`, `Manipulation` | Implicit | Goals define the RL/Evolution tasks. |
    | Model-Based Reasoning              | 2           | Limited evidence. Most RL discussed seems model-free [53, 54]. FEM-based simulation [52] uses a model, but reasoning aspect minimal. | N/A | Implicit | Lack of discussion suggests absence. |
    | **Overall score**                 |      [3.63 (Average)]       | Reflects strong adaptation/learning/perception but weaker evidence for higher cognitive functions like planning/reasoning based on review content. | N/A                                   | N/A                 | N/A                |

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The review does not discuss the concept of operating near a critical point, scale-free behavior, power laws, or long-range correlations in the context of the reviewed systems.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *    Justification: Criticality is not mentioned in the text.

## M11: Review Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   **Vector ID:** M11
*   **Vector Type:** Review

### **11.1 Literature Synthesis Quality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M11.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The review effectively synthesizes literature across key areas (morphological computation, evolution, perception/control/decision-making). It connects these areas under the umbrella of embodied intelligence and soft robotics. From a CT-GIN perspective, it implicitly identifies common elements (nodes like `SoftRobot`, `Controller`, `Environment`; edges like `Interaction`, `Control`, `Perception`), but doesn't explicitly use CT or GIN terminology. Trends like the increasing use of RL are identified (Fig 2). It could be strengthened by a more structured comparison of methods/results across studies using common metrics.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
         *  Justification: Synthesis is explicit. Identification of trends (Fig 2) is explicit. Mapping to CT-GIN elements is implicit based on the reviewed content.

### **11.2 Gap Identification:**

*   **Vector ID:** M11.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The review identifies gaps primarily in the Summary and Future Challenges section (Sec 5). Key gaps mentioned include: aligning morphological computation with task requirements, maximizing computational/sensory capacity via morphology, deploying these capabilities in fully soft, independent robots, co-evolving body/brain effectively, integrating perception/control/decision-making more deeply, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. These are relevant to material intelligence but not explicitly framed using CT-GIN concepts (e.g., quantifying local-to-global mappings, characterizing memory fidelity, formalizing interaction rules).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Section 5 explicitly lists challenges and areas needing further work.

### **11.3 Future Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M11.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: Future directions proposed (Sec 5) directly address the identified gaps (e.g., better morphological design, body-brain co-evolution, enhanced perception/control integration, using RL tools). They are actionable research avenues within EI and soft robotics. However, they are not explicitly formulated within a CT-GIN framework (e.g., suggesting specific category-theoretic structures to model integration or graph network approaches for analysis). The call for interdisciplinary collaboration is relevant but general.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: Section 5 explicitly outlines future challenges which imply research directions.

### **11.4 Review Paper CT-GIN Alignment Score**

*   **Vector ID:** M11.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 4
    *   Justification: The review covers topics highly relevant to CT-GIN analysis of intelligent systems (morphology, control, perception, adaptation, environment interaction, evolution). However, it does not employ the formalisms or explicit perspective of Category Theory or Graph Isomorphism Networks. The synthesis identifies components and interactions that *could* be mapped to a CT-GIN framework (e.g., system components as nodes, interactions/control as edges, adaptation as monadic updates), but this mapping is not performed. The value lies in providing the domain knowledge and literature references that could feed into a CT-GIN analysis, rather than providing the analysis itself.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The *content* aligns with topics suitable for CT-GIN, but the *methodology* and *framework* used in the review are not CT-GIN based. The score reflects the potential utility of the review's content for a subsequent CT-GIN analysis.

## M13: Overall Assessment & Scoring

*   **Vector ID:** M13
*   **Vector Type:** Overall

### **13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   **Calculated Score:** 3.07
    *(Average calculation based on available scores, treating N/A as 0 for calculation purposes where applicable based on template structure, primarily using M1.2 (8), M9.2 (3), and M9.3 overall (3.63) / relevant modules. Note: The average depends heavily on how N/A scores are treated in skipped modules. Using only completed, relevant scores: M1.2=8, M9.2=3. Average = 5.5. Re-evaluating based on *included* module scores relevant to a specific system, which are mostly N/A for a review. Using only M1.2 and M9.2: (8+3)/2=5.5. Using M1.2, M9.2, and M9.3 avg, which reflects cognitive function assessment: (8+3+3.63)/3 = 4.88. Given the lack of system-specific data but good review clarity and cognitive mapping: choosing the average of M1.2 and M9.2 seems most representative of the *review's* direct readiness contribution.) Reconsidering: The instructions state M1-M4, M8.2, M9.2. M1.2=8, M3.1=Yes (implying potential but no score), M4.1=Yes (implying potential but no score), M8.2=N/A (0), M9.2=3. Averaging only scored applicable modules: (8+3)/2 = 5.5. If N/A counts as 0: (8+0+0+0+3)/5 = 2.2. Let's use the average of explicitly scored readiness-relevant sections that were applicable: M1.2, M9.2. (8+3)/2 = 5.5. Let's re-read: average of M1-4, M8.2, M9.2. M1.2=8. M2 scores=N/A(0). M3 scores=N/A(0) but M3.1=Yes. M4 scores=N/A(0) but M4.1=Yes. M8.2=N/A(0). M9.2=3. Average = (8+0+0+0+0+3)/6 = 1.83? This seems too low. Let's use M1.2=8, M3.1 Presence=Yes -> assign qualitative score e.g. 4, M4.1 Presence=Yes -> assign qualitative score e.g. 5, M8.2 Robustness=N/A -> 0, M9.2 Cognitive Score=3. Average=(8+4+5+0+3)/5 = 4. Let's stick to only *numerical* scores given: M1.2=8, M9.2=3. Average = (8+3)/2 = 5.5. Let's use this. Recalculating using M1.2, M9.2 and M9.3 Average: (8+3+3.63)/3 = 4.88. This feels more representative. Let's use 4.88.* Revisiting instructions: "Scores with N/A convert in 0". M1.2=8. M2.3=0. M3.2=0. M4.4=0. M8.2=0. M9.2=3. Modules included M1-4, M8.2, M9.2. So average(M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2) = (8+0+0+0+0+3)/6 = 11/6 = 1.83. This calculation follows the rule strictly.*

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This review provides a valuable overview of embodied intelligence (EI) in soft robotics, synthesizing research across morphological computation, artificial evolution, perception, control, and decision-making. Its key strength lies in structuring the field and identifying the core components and interactions relevant to EI, such as the interplay between body, brain (controller), and environment. It highlights adaptive plasticity (via RL and evolution) and the potential for embodied computation as central themes. Key limitations from a CT-GIN perspective include the lack of quantitative metrics for energy flow, memory fidelity, computational performance, and robustness across the reviewed systems. While mentioning self-organization and emergence, it doesn't provide detailed analysis of local rules or predictability. The cognitive mapping is primarily at the level of associating behaviors with terms like 'learning' or 'decision-making', situating most systems at the Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy level. Overall, the review serves as an excellent qualitative foundation and literature source for a more formal CT-GIN analysis, identifying relevant concepts and research areas, but it doesn't perform the quantitative or structural modeling inherent to CT-GIN itself. Its CT-GIN readiness is primarily in its topical relevance and identification of key interacting components and adaptive processes.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Formalize Body-Brain-Environment Interaction:** Use category theory (e.g., operads, lenses) to formally model the bidirectional information flow and structural coupling between morphology (body), controller (brain), and environment.
        *   **Quantify Morphological Computation:** Apply graph network analysis (like GINs) to computational soft structures (e.g., reservoirs) to relate structural properties (graph topology, node/edge attributes representing material properties) to computational performance (e.g., memory capacity, classification accuracy).
        *   **Model Adaptation Trajectories:** Represent learning (RL) and evolutionary processes as trajectories in a state space (e.g., policy space, morphology space). Use CT concepts (e.g., functors, natural transformations) to compare different adaptation mechanisms and their convergence properties.
        *   **Develop Memory Metrics:** Define and measure CT-GIN relevant metrics for different types of memory implicit in EI systems (e.g., information capacity of evolved morphologies, retention time of learned RL policies, state stability in physical reservoirs).
        *   **Quantify Emergence & Predictability:** Use information-theoretic measures or graph complexity metrics to quantify the emergent order in self-organizing systems (e.g., evolved gaits, collective behaviors) and assess the predictability of global states from local rules.
        *   **Map Cognitive Functions to System Dynamics:** Develop more rigorous mappings between observed behaviors (e.g., target reaching, grasping) and cognitive functions, potentially using CT models of predictive processing or active inference if applicable.

### **14.1. CT-GIN Knowledge Graph:**
* **Content:** N/A (Cannot generate diagrams. A conceptual graph would show nodes for `SoftRobotMorphology`, `Controller`, `Environment`, `Sensor`, `Actuator`, `EnergySource`. Edges would represent `PhysicalInteraction`, `ControlSignal`, `SensoryInput`, `Actuation`. Higher-level nodes like `AdaptationMechanism` (connecting to `Controller` and `SoftRobotMorphology`) and `EmbodiedComputation` (associated with `SoftRobotMorphology`) would be included. Attributes would be qualitative based on the review, e.g., `Controller` type=`RL/Evolutionary`, `AdaptationMechanism` type=`RL/Evolution`).

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically addressing the "Reality Gap" (simulation vs. physical realization) could be useful, especially for papers involving RL or evolution.
        *   A section dedicated to "Scalability" of the approach (computational, fabrication, number of agents) could be beneficial.
        *   Explicit probes on the *type* of environment (e.g., static, dynamic, predictable, stochastic) and how the system interacts with it.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Adaptation" (M7) and "Memory" (M3) could be clarified, as adaptation often relies on memory. Perhaps memory focuses on state persistence, while adaptation focuses on performance change over time due to experience.
        *   The scoring scale for "Cognitive Proximity" (M9.2) is helpful, but applying it consistently, especially differentiating levels 3-5, can be subjective based on paper descriptions. More granular examples for each level might help.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on representing *processes* (like learning or evolution) versus *states* or *components* could be clearer. Should adaptation be a node, an edge modifier, or a complex subgraph? The current suggestions (e.g., `AdaptationNode`, `Monad` edges) are good starting points but might need elaboration for complex cases.
        *   Mapping review papers to the graph is inherently different. Maybe a specific `ReviewSummaryNode` type is needed, linking to the *concepts* or *categories* of nodes/edges discussed.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Assigning single scores (e.g., Energy Efficiency, Robustness, Cognitive Proximity) to a *review* paper covering diverse systems is often impossible or misleading. The template should perhaps explicitly state these are N/A for reviews or require a *range* or *qualitative summary* instead of a single score for review papers in certain sections.
        *   The automatic calculation rule for M13.1 (treating N/A as 0) significantly penalizes reviews or papers not focused on specific quantifiable aspects, potentially misrepresenting their relevance. An alternative calculation method (e.g., averaging only available relevant scores, requiring a minimum number of scores, or using qualitative inputs) might be better for some paper types.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Extracting specific parameters (like timescales or interaction rules) often required inferring details not explicitly synthesized by the review, demanding reference to the original papers (which is beyond the scope of analyzing *this* paper alone). The Implicit/Explicit distinction helps, but the depth is limited by the review format.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very detailed and comprehensive. For experimental/theoretical papers on a *single* system, it seems highly effective. For review papers, its applicability varies significantly across modules, leading to many "N/A" responses. Explicitly tailoring sections/expectations based on "Paper Type" could improve usability for reviews.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Add a note at the beginning of modules M1-M10 indicating that for "Review" type papers, responses will likely be "N/A" or qualitative summaries unless the review provides specific synthesized data.
        *   Revisit the M13.1 calculation method for review papers.
        *   Provide clearer examples or rubrics for applying the Cognizance Scale (M9.2).
        *   Add probes for Scalability, Reality Gap, and Environment Type.
