## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system consists of two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic channels embedded in a fluidic cell separating two reservoirs filled with an aqueous electrolyte (KCl, NaCl, LiCl, CaCl2, NiSO4, or AlCl3). Two types of channels were investigated: 1) "Pristine" channels made of MoS2 flakes separated by graphene nanoribbon spacers (height 0.68-86 nm). 2) "Activated" carbon channels made from graphite flakes with a nanoscaletrench milled via EBIE (height 4-13 nm), exhibiting higher surface charge. The channels are fabricated on SiNx membranes. The system's purpose is to investigate ion transport under confinement and demonstrate memory effects (memristance) potentially applicable to neuromorphic computing and bio-inspired iontronics. It functions by measuring ionic current under an applied time-dependent voltage using Ag/AgCl electrodes and a patch-clamp amplifier, revealing conductance hysteresis and memory phenomena. These phenomena are linked to interfacial processes like ionic self-assembly (Wien effect, Bjerrum pairs in pristine channels) or surface adsorption/entry effects (in activated carbon or due to geometric asymmetry). The system demonstrates synapse-like dynamics and Hebbian learning capabilities.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: NanofluidicChannel_2D, `domain`: Nanofluidics/Iontronics, `mechanism`: ConfinedIonTransport/InterfacialProcesses/Memristance, `components`: [MoS2, Graphene, Graphite, SiNx, AqueousElectrolyte, AgAgCl_Electrode, PatchClampAmplifier], `purpose`: InvestigateMemoryEffects/NeuromorphicComputing Emulation.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the materials, fabrication methods (referencing SM and prior work), experimental setup, electrolytes used, measurement techniques, observed phenomena (memristance, Hebbian learning), and proposed mechanisms.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper clearly describes the two main types of channels (pristine MoS2, activated carbon), the general fabrication approach (referencing supplementary materials and prior publications like (13) and (16) for specifics), the experimental setup (fluidic cell, reservoirs, electrolytes, electrodes, measurement device), and the basic measurement protocol (applied voltage, current measurement, conductance calculation). Key differences between channel types (materials, fabrication details affecting surface charge, height control) are highlighted. However, full, self-contained fabrication details and measurement specifics require consulting the supplementary materials and cited works, slightly reducing the score from a perfect 10 based solely on the main text provided.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The core components and setup are explicitly described, but full details necessary for exact replication rely on explicitly referenced external sources (SM, refs 13, 16).

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Pristine Channel Height | 0.68 - 86 | nm | Para 3, Pg 1; Para 3, Pg 2 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Activated Channel Height | 4 - 13 | nm | Para 3, Pg 1; Para 3, Pg 2 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Electrolyte Concentration | 1 - 3000 (3 M) | mM | Para 4, Pg 1 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Applied Voltage Amplitude | 0.1 - 1 | V | Para 4, Pg 1 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Voltage Frequency | 0.1 - 200 | mHz | Para 4, Pg 1; Para 2, Pg 2 | Explicit | High | N/A |

    *   **Note:** These parameters are crucial for defining the experimental conditions under which memristive behavior was observed. Reliability is high as these are directly stated experimental parameters.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy source is electrical energy supplied by a patch-clamp amplifier (Keithley 2400 or 2600 Series) applying a time-dependent voltage V(t) across Ag/AgCl electrodes immersed in the electrolyte reservoirs connected by the nanofluidic channel.
    *   Value: Up to 1 (amplitude)
    *   Units: V (Volts)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: PatchClampAmplifier, `type`: ElectricalVoltage
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly states the use of a patch-clamp amplifier to apply a time-dependent voltage drop V(t) with amplitudes up to 1V.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: Electrical energy input (voltage difference) drives the transport of solvated ions (charge carriers) through the nanofluidic channel, constituting an ionic current I(t). This involves the conversion of electrical potential energy into the kinetic energy of ions and overcoming resistive forces within the channel. The memristive effect implies energy is also stored/dissipated through changes in the system's internal state related to ion configurations (e.g., ion pair formation/breaking in the Wien effect, ion adsorption/desorption, ion accumulation/depletion near channel entrances). Energy associated with these configurational changes affects the channel's conductance.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Electromigration/IonTransport/StateChange, `from_node`: EnergyInputNode, `to_node`: SystemNode (representing ionic kinetic energy and internal state energy).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The driving force (voltage) and resulting ionic current are explicit. The conversion to kinetic energy and overcoming resistance is implicit physics. The energy associated with internal state changes (pairing, adsorption) is explicitly discussed as the *mechanism* for memory but the energy transduction aspect itself is implicit.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not quantify energy efficiency. The primary purpose is information processing (memory, learning emulation), not energy conversion or storage in the traditional sense. Most input electrical energy is likely dissipated as heat due to ionic friction and overcoming channel resistance (Joule heating), and potentially during the internal state changes (ion pairing/unpairing, adsorption/desorption). Efficiency for the intended *computational* task might be considered differently, but energy efficiency in the thermodynamic sense is expected to be very low. Score justification: Low efficiency expected for energy transduction; primary function is computation/memory where efficiency metrics are different and not provided.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `efficiency` (Low) of relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: Efficiency is not discussed or measured. The low score is inferred based on the physical processes involved (ion transport through resistive channel).

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Energy dissipation primarily occurs through resistive losses (Joule heating) as ions move through the electrolyte and the confined channel. Friction between ions and solvent, and ions and channel walls contributes. Additional dissipation occurs during the processes underlying memory: energy is required to break ion pairs (Wien effect) or desorb ions from surfaces, and energy is released upon pairing or adsorption. The hysteresis loop itself represents energy dissipated per voltage cycle. The paper notes that capacitive effects are negligible at the frequencies used (0.1-200 mHz), suggesting minimal dissipation through dielectric losses in this regime. Quantification is not provided, but dissipation is inherent to ionic conduction and the observed hysteresis. Qualitative assessment: High overall dissipation relative to energy potentially stored in memory states.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode` (type: JouleHeating, InterfacialProcessLoss) and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s connecting `SystemNode` or `EnergyTransductionEdge` to `EnergyDissipationNode`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The existence of ionic current implies resistive dissipation (implicit physics). Hysteresis loops indicating energy loss per cycle are shown explicitly (Fig 1). Specific mechanisms like pairing/adsorption are discussed explicitly, implying associated energy changes, but dissipation isn't quantified. Negligible capacitance is stated explicitly.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly reports the "emergence of memory in the transport of aqueous electrolytes" and identifies the systems as "nanofluidic memristors". This memory manifests as conductance hysteresis (I-V curve loops pinched at the origin, G-V loops) under time-varying voltage, where the channel's conductance G(t) depends on the history of the applied voltage V(t). This history-dependent conductance influences future current response (I=GV). Both short-term (<2 min) and long-term (>2 min, up to hours) memory effects are observed (Fig. 4B).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The paper's central theme is the demonstration and explanation of memory effects, explicitly using terms like "memory", "memristor", "hysteresis", "short-term memory", and "long-term memory".

**(Conditional: M3.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M3.2 and M3.3.)**

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 7
*   Justification: The system exhibits memristive memory, characterized by history-dependent conductance. Two types are identified: unipolar (conductance depends on voltage magnitude, linked to Wien effect/ion pairing) and bipolar (conductance depends on voltage polarity, linked to entry effects/surface charge). The conductance state can be modified ("written", "erased") by voltage pulses and retained over long timescales (minutes to hours), enabling Hebbian learning emulation. This demonstrates rewritability and retention. The memory appears analog-like, as conductance can be incrementally adjusted (Fig. 4A, 4C). Capacity isn't explicitly quantified in terms of distinct states but seems continuous over a range. Readout is via conductance measurement, accuracy not specified but implicitly sufficient for experiments. Stability is demonstrated over minutes/hours but relaxation occurs (Fig. 4B). Score justification: Demonstrates key memory features (retention, rewritability, analog nature) relevant to neuromorphic computing, but full characterization (capacity, precise readout accuracy, long-term degradation) is limited in the excerpt.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type, attributes: `memoryMechanism`: [Memristive_Unipolar, Memristive_Bipolar], `encoding`: ConductanceState.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: Memristive behavior and types (unipolar/bipolar) are explicit. Analog nature is implied by gradual changes in Fig 4A/C and continuous models used. Retention times are explicit. Capacity and readout accuracy are implicit or N/A.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: 50 - 400 (typical experimental range); Qualitative: Minutes to Hours
*    Units: s (seconds)
*   Justification: The paper states memory ranges "from minutes to hours" (Abstract, Para 1 Pg 2). It mentions dynamical time scales "from seconds to hours" (Para 2 Pg 2). Figure 4B shows both short-term (<2 min) and long-term (>2 min) memory components after a pulse. The text references figs S12 and S14 for experimental memory time values (tm) found to be in the range of 50 to 400 s, extracted from loop area analysis (Para 4, Pg 4 & Fig 3C caption). Theoretical estimates are also ~100s (Para 4 Pg 4).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: Qualitative range "minutes to hours" and quantitative range "50 to 400 s" (referencing SM figures) are explicitly stated. Short/long term distinction also explicit.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `retentionTime` range: [50, 400] s of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: N/A (appears analog)
*   Units: N/A (potentially range of conductance values)
*   Justification: The paper does not quantify memory capacity in terms of discrete states or bits. Figure 4C shows conductance being incrementally increased and decreased over 30 "write" and 30 "erase" pulses, suggesting an analog or quasi-analog range of accessible conductance states rather than a specific number of distinct levels. The text mentions storing an "analog variable" (Para 2, Pg 5). The range of conductance change can be large (up to two orders of magnitude in unipolar memristors, Fig 1C), but the number of reliably distinguishable states within that range is not determined.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Lack of explicit quantification. Analog nature is inferred from figures and text description.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `capacityType`: Analog of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: Readout is performed by applying a weak voltage pulse (0.1V, 5s in Fig 4) and measuring the current to determine conductance (G=I/V). The paper states this "read pulse" had "no noticeable impact on the state of the system". However, the accuracy or error rate of this readout process (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, variability) is not quantified.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
       *  Justification: Readout method is explicit, but its accuracy/error is not mentioned or quantified.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `ReadoutEdge` connecting `MemoryNode` to `MeasurementNode`, attribute `method`: LowVoltagePulse.

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A (Qualitative: Relaxation occurs)
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: Figure 4B explicitly shows conductance relaxing from a high post-spike value towards a long-term potentiated state over ~2 minutes, indicating decay/degradation of the initial potentiation. The long-term state itself persists longer (minutes/hours). However, a specific rate constant or percentage loss over time for the long-term memory state is not quantified in the provided text.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
            * Justification: The presence of relaxation/decay is explicitly shown in Fig 4B and mentioned ("relaxing"). A quantitative rate is not provided (N/A).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `degradationBehavior`: Relaxation exists of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Write (+1V, 10s)    | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | Fig 4             | N/A               | Energy/Power not measured/reported. |
    | Erase (-1V, 10s)    | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | Fig 4             | N/A               | Energy/Power not measured/reported. |
    | Read (+0.1V, 5s)    | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | Fig 4             | N/A               | Energy/Power not measured/reported. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper does not report measurements or calculations related to the energy consumption or power usage of memory operations (write, erase, read).

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | Robustness | Persistence across conditions | Observed | N/A | Attribute `robustness`: Qualitative of `MemoryNode` | Para 2, Pg 2; figs S9-S16 | Explicit | Memristive effect observed over wide range of conc., height, pH, electrolytes. |
    | Reversibility | Ability to return to initial state | Demonstrated | N/A | Attribute `reversibility`: Yes of `MemoryNode` | Fig 4C | Explicit | System returns to initial conductance after equal write/erase cycles. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
*   Justification: Robustness and reversibility are explicitly discussed and demonstrated (Fig 4C), although not quantified with specific metrics like error rates or cycle endurance.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Partial/Unclear
    *   Justification: The mechanisms proposed for memory involve local processes like ion pairing/clustering (Wien effect) and ion adsorption/desorption. Ionic self-assembly into Bjerrum pairs or polyelectrolytic arcs under confinement is explicitly mentioned (citing Ref 17). These could be considered forms of local self-organization influencing the global conductance state. However, the paper does not demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of large-scale spatial patterns or structures typically associated with self-organization in complex systems. The global order observed is primarily the hysteretic conductance state, which emerges from these local ionic processes driven by the external voltage, rather than spontaneous pattern formation in the absence of a driving field or solely from local interactions.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Local mechanisms involving ionic assembly/adsorption are explicitly discussed. Whether this constitutes "self-organization" in the broader sense (emergent complex spatial patterns without global control) is an interpretation (implicit) and arguably only partially met.

**(Conditional: M4.1 is "Partial/Unclear", proceeding with M4.2-M4.7 with appropriate caveats)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The local "rules" are the physical laws governing ion behavior under confinement and electric fields:
        1.  **Electrostatics:** Coulomb interactions between ions (leading to pairing/clustering like Bjerrum pairs, especially under strong confinement where dielectric constant might be lower), interactions between ions and charged channel walls (surface charge effects, ion exclusion/accumulation), ion interaction with the applied electric field (driving force).
        2.  **Ion-Surface Interactions:** Adsorption/desorption dynamics of ions onto channel walls (relevant for stop-and-go transport and bipolar memristors in activated carbon). Chemical affinity between specific ions and surface sites/defects influences this.
        3.  **Hydrodynamics:** Confined fluid flow and ion mobility, potentially affected by electroosmosis and slippage (mentioned for activated carbon).
        4.  **Diffusion:** Random thermal motion of ions.
        Equations from Ref 17 (cited for Wien effect/pairing) or standard electrokinetic models would provide mathematical descriptions, but are not detailed in this excerpt. Eq 1 (G ~ |V|^a) and Eq 2 (G(V>0) ~ b_Rect * G(V<0)) describe macroscopic consequences of these local interactions (non-linear conductance) rather than the rules themselves. Eq 3 (tm ~ tdiff * td/ta) models memory time based on adsorption dynamics.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Governs `IonNode`-`IonNode`, `IonNode`-`SurfaceNode`, `IonNode`-`FieldNode` interactions. Edges could represent `ElectrostaticInteraction`, `AdsorptionInteraction`, `HydrodynamicDrag`.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: The physical processes (electrostatics, adsorption, diffusion) are explicitly mentioned or implied. Specific mathematical rules/equations governing these local interactions are mostly implicit or referenced externally (Ref 17), except for the macroscopic consequence equations (Eq 1-3).

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**</h3>

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------ | :---------- | :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------: | :----------------: | :------------: |
    | Electrostatics | Ion Pairing (Bjerrum) | Bjerrum Length | N/A | nm | Theory (Ref 17) | Implicit | Parameter mentioned in context of theory, not measured. |
    | Ion-Surface | Adsorption | Adsorption time (ta) | N/A | s | Theory (Eq 3) | Implicit | Parameter in theoretical model, not measured. |
    | Ion-Surface | Desorption | Desorption time (td) | N/A | s | Theory (Eq 3) | Implicit | Parameter in theoretical model, not measured. |
    | Surface Charge | Charge Density | High (Activated) vs Moderate (Pristine) | N/A | C/m^2 | Text descr. | Explicit (Qualitative) | Explicitly stated difference, but value N/A. |
    | Diffusion | Ion Diffusivity (D) | N/A | m^2/s | Theory (Sec 4, Pg 4) | Implicit | Used in theoretical scaling, value N/A. |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The primary "global order" described is the collective ion transport behavior resulting in a specific, history-dependent macroscopic conductance state G(t) of the entire channel. This manifests as the shape and area of the I-V or G-V hysteresis loops under periodic voltage forcing. It is a functional order (conductance state) rather than a spatial structural order.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Represents the state of the `SystemNode`, potentially linked to a `GlobalStateNode` with attribute `conductance`.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The hysteretic conductance state is the main experimental observation and focus (Fig 1, text).

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The hysteretic behavior (global order) appears reproducible and is qualitatively consistent across different conditions (Fig 1, S9-S16). A minimal model (Eq 4, convolution with memory kernel) shows good agreement with experimental I-V curves (Fig 3 A, B), suggesting a degree of predictability based on the quasistatic conductance and memory time. The dependence of loop area on frequency also matches the model reasonably well (Fig 3C). However, inherent stochasticity in ion transport, adsorption, and pairing at the nanoscale likely introduces variability not fully captured. Predictability is demonstrated through model fitting, but quantitative metrics like correlation coefficients are not provided in the excerpt. Score justification: Model agreement suggests good predictability, but lack of quantitative metrics and inherent stochasticity prevent a higher score.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: Reproducibility is implied by consistent figures and claims of robustness (explicit). Predictability is demonstrated via model fitting (explicit comparison shown in Fig 3), but quantitative metrics are absent (implicit).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: e.g., Could relate to the stability or variance attribute of the `GlobalStateNode`.

### **4.5. Local Interaction Rules (for Self-Organization)**
* **Vector ID:** M4.5
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Rule ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |

| Pairing | Wien effect / Bjerrum pairs | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Based on cited theory (Ref 17) and discussion linking unipolar memristors to this mechanism. | Text, Ref 17 |
| Adsorption | Ion adsorption/desorption on walls | td/ta ratio | High (est. Du~10^2-10^3) | Dimensionless | Mixed | Mechanism explicit, ratio estimated via Dukhin number (Du), suggesting ta << td. | Eq 3, Text (Pg 4) |
| Rectification | Asymmetric entry/exit resistance | Rectification factor (b_Rect) | 1 - 5 | Dimensionless | Explicit | Mechanism proposed, factor range explicitly measured. | Eq 2, Text (Pg 3), SM Sec 3 |

### **4.6. Globally Emergent Order and Order Parameters**
* **Vector ID:** M4.6
* **Vector Type:** Table

| Property ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Protocol | Source |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :------: | :-----: |
| Conductance | Macroscopic channel conductance | G(t) | Varies (e.g., Fig 1C shows ~0.1-10 nS) | S (Siemens) | Explicit | Primary measured quantity defining the system state. | Current/Voltage meas. | Eq G=I/V, Fig 1 |
| Hysteresis | I-V loop characteristic | Loop Area | Varies with freq. (Fig 3C) | A⋅V | Explicit | Quantifies the memory effect and energy dissipation per cycle. | I-V curve integration | Fig 1, Fig 3 |
| Memory | Persistence of conductance state | Memory time (tm) | 50 - 400 | s | Explicit | Timescale over which the conductance state is retained. | Loop area vs freq. analysis | Fig 3C, Text (Pg 4) |

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | Local Processes to Global Conductance | How local ion dynamics (pairing, adsorption) determine macroscopic conductance hysteresis | Medium-High (via models) | 1 | Model fit (R^2 N/A), Loop Area vs Freq | Mixed | Models (Eq 1-4) link local physics concepts to observed global behavior (Fig 3), but Yoneda formalism not used. Score reflects basic causal link, not formal CT mapping fidelity. | Text, Fig 3 |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** 1
    *   **Metrics:** Qualitative model agreement (Fig 3), Reproducibility implies consistent mapping.
    *   **Justification:** The paper establishes plausible physical links (models based on local effects like pairing, adsorption, rectification) that explain the observed global behavior (conductance hysteresis). The minimal model (Eq 4) shows good agreement (Fig 3), suggesting the global behavior is largely predictable from the assumed local dynamics and memory kernel. However, the analysis does not use Category Theory or Yoneda embedding formalism. The score of 1 reflects the existence of a proposed, moderately predictable local-to-global link, but acknowledges the absence of a formal CT treatment or rigorous quantification of mapping fidelity in those terms.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates Hebbian learning (specifically, spike timing-dependent plasticity - STDP), a fundamental form of biological computation/learning. Voltage pulses mimicking pre- and post-synaptic spikes are applied, and the channel's conductance (synaptic weight analogue) is modified based on their relative timing (Fig 5). This computation (conductance update based on temporal input correlation) is performed intrinsically by the physical dynamics of ions within the nanofluidic channel in response to the voltage protocol, not by an external controller calculating the update rule.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The implementation and results of Hebbian learning using the device are explicitly described and presented as a key result (Section "Hebbian learning with nanofluidic memristors", Fig 5).

**(Conditional: M5.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Neuromorphic / Analog
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type: Neuromorphic.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *    Justification: The paper explicitly frames the work in the context of "neuromorphic iontronics", "biomimetic computations", and emulating "biological synapses" and "Hebbian learning". The conductance changes appear analog or quasi-analog (Fig 4C), fitting the description of analog computation.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: The basic computational operation demonstrated is the **history-dependent modulation of conductance**, analogous to synaptic weight update in neuromorphic systems. Specifically, it implements a form of **Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**. The change in conductance (ΔG) depends on the relative timing (Δt) of input voltage pulses (pre- and post-synaptic analogues). ΔG = f(Δt), where f is approximated by the curve in Fig 5D (potentiation for pre-before-post, depression for post-before-pre within a time window). This relies on the bipolar memristor behavior where positive/negative voltage pulses increase/decrease conductance, and the duration of these pulses is controlled by the spike timing protocol.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** STDP / Synaptic Weight Update
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `ComputationNode` function: STDP_WeightUpdate.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The STDP-like behavior is explicitly demonstrated through the Hebbian learning protocol and results shown in Fig 5D. The underlying primitive is the voltage-history-dependent conductance modulation inherent to the memristor.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Partial/Unclear
    *   Justification: The system adapts its internal state (conductance) based on the history of inputs (voltage pulses) in a way that implements Hebbian learning ("neurons that fire together, wire together"). This adaptation process, where conductance increases for correlated firing (pre-before-post) and decreases for anti-correlated firing (post-before-pre), could be loosely interpreted as the system trying to "predict" or reinforce causal relationships in its input, thus minimizing a form of "surprise" associated with uncorrelated inputs. The conductance state acts as a rudimentary internal model of input correlations. However, the paper does not explicitly frame the behavior in terms of Active Inference, nor does it describe mechanisms for explicit prediction generation or error calculation based on a generative model. The adaptation follows a prescribed Hebbian rule implemented physically, rather than a general prediction error minimization process.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Connection to Active Inference is an interpretation based on the observed adaptive behavior (Hebbian learning); it is not mentioned in the paper. The presence of adaptation and history dependence is explicit.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A (Connection is too weak/speculative based on provided text).

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system exhibits adaptive plasticity, explicitly demonstrated through the Hebbian learning protocol (Fig 5). The channel's conductance (internal state/structure analogue) is persistently modified based on the temporal pattern of applied voltage pulses (experience). Positive pulses generally increase conductance, negative pulses decrease it (Fig 4A), and the relative timing of pulse sequences leads to STDP (Fig 5D). This change persists over time (long-term memory) and alters the system's future response (current for a given voltage), fitting the definition of adaptive plasticity.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: Conductance modification through voltage pulses and the implementation of Hebbian learning/STDP are explicitly described and demonstrated as key findings.

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M7.2)**

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The mechanism of adaptation is the voltage-induced change in the channel's internal state, which determines its conductance. For **bipolar memristors** (used for Hebbian learning), the mechanism is attributed to polarity-dependent processes, likely related to asymmetric entry/exit effects coupled with surface charge, leading to ion accumulation (conductance increase) or depletion (conductance decrease) depending on voltage polarity (Fig 2B). Positive voltage pulses ('write', pre-before-post potentiation) drive cations in a way that accumulates charge/increases conductance, while negative pulses ('erase', post-before-pre depression) reverse this. The persistence (memory) is linked to slow "stop-and-go" ion transport possibly mediated by surface adsorption/desorption (Eq 3, Fig 2D). For **unipolar memristors**, adaptation would involve changing the balance of paired vs. unpaired ions via the Wien effect (Fig 2A), driven by voltage magnitude, with persistence potentially linked to clustering dynamics (Fig 2C). The Hebbian learning protocol leverages the polarity dependence of bipolar devices to implement STDP.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `AdaptationNode` type, `mechanism`: [Accumulation/Depletion (Bipolar), IonPairing/Clustering (Unipolar), SurfaceAdsorption (Persistence)]. Edges could be `VoltageInputEdge` triggering state change in `MemoryNode`. Learning Rule: `STDP`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the different mechanisms proposed for unipolar (Wien effect, pairing) and bipolar (entry effects, asymmetry, accumulation/depletion) memristors and links them to the observed conductance changes and memory. The link between surface processes (adsorption) and long timescales is also explicit (Eq 3). Hebbian learning implementation via voltage protocol is explicit.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The main functional behaviors described are:
        1.  **Memristive Effect:** History-dependent conductance, manifesting as pinched hysteresis loops in I-V curves and conductance loops in G-V curves under periodic voltage driving (Fig 1 B-E). Exists in unipolar and bipolar forms.
        2.  **Synaptic Plasticity Analogue:** Ability to reversibly modify conductance using voltage pulses (write/erase), mimicking synaptic potentiation and depression (Fig 4 A, C). Includes both short-term and long-term memory components (Fig 4B).
        3.  **Hebbian Learning (STDP):** Implementation of spike timing-dependent plasticity, where the change in channel conductance depends on the relative timing of voltage pulses mimicking pre- and post-synaptic neuron firing (Fig 5).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: `Memristance`, `SynapticPlasticity`, `STDP_Learning`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors are the core findings explicitly reported and characterized in the paper (Abstract, Introduction, Results sections, Figs 1, 3, 4, 5).

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper states the memristive phenomenon was found to be "robust" and was observed "in a wide range of parameters—notably salt concentration, channel height, and pH" and for "all tested electrolytes" (Para 2, Pg 2). Corresponding data is provided in SM (figs S9-S16). The Hebbian learning was demonstrated in activated carbon channels (Fig 5). Robustness to component failure or large environmental fluctuations beyond the tested ranges is not assessed. Quantitative metrics for robustness (e.g., operational window size, failure rate over cycles, noise tolerance) are not provided. Score justification: Explicit claims of robustness across several key parameters, supported by references to SM data, suggest good robustness, but lack of quantitative metrics or endurance testing limits score.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Qualitative claim of robustness is explicit. Specific parameter ranges tested are explicit. Lack of quantitative robustness metrics or cycle endurance data makes a full assessment implicit/N/A.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `robustnessScore`: 7 of the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content:
        *   **Memristance:** Validated experimentally by applying periodic voltage waveforms (sinusoidal, triangular) and measuring current. Plotting I vs V reveals pinched hysteresis loops, and G (=I/V) vs V shows characteristic loops (twisted for unipolar, simple for bipolar), which are the defining signatures ("hallmark") of memristors (Fig 1 B-E). Control experiments implied by stating capacitive effects are negligible at these frequencies. Reproducibility suggested by consistency across figures and robustness claims.
        *   **Synaptic Plasticity:** Validated by applying discrete voltage pulses (+1V write, -1V erase, +0.1V read) and measuring conductance changes over time. Demonstrated potentiation/increase with positive pulses, depression/decrease with negative pulses, short-term relaxation, and long-term retention (Fig 4A, B). Reversibility shown by returning to initial state after balanced write/erase cycles (Fig 4C).
        *   **Hebbian Learning (STDP):** Validated by implementing a specific protocol mimicking pre- and post-synaptic spike timing using voltage pulses applied to the channel. The resulting percentage change in conductance was measured as a function of the relative spike timing (Δt). The characteristic STDP curve (potentiation for Δt > 0, depression for Δt < 0 within a window) was experimentally obtained (Fig 5D).
        Limitations: Statistical validation (e.g., number of devices tested, variability) is not detailed in the excerpt (likely in SM). Long-term endurance/stability over many cycles not reported.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The experimental methods and results used to demonstrate and validate each behavior (hysteresis loops, conductance changes from pulses, STDP curve) are explicitly described and shown in figures.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, there is an explicit mapping of the system's functionality to cognitive/biological processes. The nanofluidic memristor is directly compared to a biological synapse. Its history-dependent conductance is analogous to synaptic weight. The observed short-term and long-term memory effects are compared to synaptic plasticity (short-term potentiation/depression, long-term potentiation/depression - LTP/LTD). The implementation of STDP directly mimics a fundamental learning rule found in biological neural networks (Hebbian learning). The overall goal is stated as enabling "biomimetic computations on aqueous electrolytic chips" and "neuromorphic iontronics". Limitations: The mapping is functional; the underlying physical mechanisms (ion transport, adsorption) are different from the biochemical processes in biological synapses (neurotransmitter release, receptor activation, Ca2+ dynamics etc.), although both involve ion movement and accumulation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines a `CognitiveMappingEdge` connecting `BehaviorArchetypeNode` (e.g., `Memristance`, `SynapticPlasticity`, `STDP_Learning`) to `CognitiveFunctionNode` (e.g., `SynapticWeight`, `SynapticPlasticity`, `HebbianLearning`).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly uses terms like "synapse-like dynamics", "analogues of biological synapses", "Hebbian learning", "neuromorphic", "bioinspired", "LTP/LTD analogues" throughout the text when describing the system's behavior and potential applications.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates key features analogous to synaptic plasticity, including history-dependent modulation (memory) and adaptation based on input timing (STDP/Hebbian learning). This goes beyond simple responsivity (Level 1) and shows adaptive behavior relevant to learning (Level 2/3). The conductance state acts as a simple internal state modified by experience. The Hebbian learning implementation suggests a basic form of reactive/adaptive autonomy where the system modifies its "connections" based on input patterns. However, it lacks goal-directed behavior based on internal models (Level 4), complex representations, planning, or higher cognitive functions. The computation performed is localized (synapse analogue), not integrated into a larger network performing complex tasks within this paper. Score justification: Clear demonstration of adaptive plasticity and a fundamental learning rule (Level 3), but limited to a single component analogue without demonstration of higher-level integration or model-based reasoning.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The demonstrated behaviors (memory, STDP) are explicit. The scoring involves comparing these explicit behaviors to the levels defined in the Cognizance Scale, which is an assessment based on the provided framework (implicit evaluation).

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a compelling experimental demonstration of memristive behavior and synapse-like dynamics in 2D nanofluidic channels. Key strengths lie in the clear identification of memory (M3), its temporal characteristics (minutes-hours retention, M6), and adaptive plasticity through the successful implementation of STDP (M7, M5), providing a strong link to neuromorphic concepts (M9). The system description and basic operation are relatively clear (M1). However, several limitations exist from a CT-GIN perspective. Energy flow analysis is weak, lacking efficiency or dissipation quantification (M2). While local mechanisms are proposed for memory, self-organization beyond functional conductance states is limited (M4). Computational capabilities are currently restricted to the STDP primitive (M5), and robustness/fidelity metrics are largely qualitative or absent (M8, M3). The cognitive proximity score (M9) is low, reflecting the system's status as a component analogue rather than demonstrating integrated cognitive function. Overall, the work establishes a promising physical platform for ion-based memory and learning, showing good readiness in demonstrating core memory and adaptation phenomena (M3, M7), but requires significant further research in quantification, network integration, energy analysis, and computational complexity to advance towards robust, scalable cognizant matter systems within the CT-GIN framework.

*   **Vector Type:** Visualization

### **14.1. CT-GIN Knowledge Graph:**
* **Content:**
[Schematic Description: The CT-GIN graph would center around a `SystemNode` (NanofluidicChannel_2D).
*   An `EnergyInputNode` (PatchClampAmplifier, ElectricalVoltage) connects via an `EnergyTransductionEdge` (Electromigration, efficiency=Low) to the `SystemNode`. `EnergyDissipationNode`s (JouleHeating, InterfacialProcessLoss) connect from the system/transduction edge.
*   The `SystemNode` contains or links to a `MemoryNode` (Memristive, type=ShortTerm/LongTerm, retention=50-400s, capacity=Analog).
*   The `MemoryNode` state (conductance) is influenced by the `EnergyInputNode` via `AdaptationEdges` implementing the STDP rule (`AdaptationNode`).
*   The collective behavior leads to `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s (`Memristance`, `SynapticPlasticity`, `STDP_Learning`) linked to the `SystemNode`. Robustness score (7) annotates these nodes.
*   `CognitiveMappingEdges` link `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s to `CognitiveFunctionNode`s (`SynapticWeight`, `HebbianLearning`), with an overall `CognitiveProximityScore` (3) associated.
*   Temporal aspects are captured by attributes on nodes/edges (e.g., `MemoryNode` retention time, STDP time window).
*   Local interaction rules (M4.2) conceptually define edges between hypothetical `IonNode`s and `SurfaceNode`s within the `SystemNode`'s internal structure, leading to the macroscopic `MemoryNode` state, but this fine structure is not explicitly modeled.]

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A dedicated section/probe for quantifying **stochasticity vs. determinism** in behavior and memory states could be useful, especially for nanoscale systems.
        *   Probes related to **scalability** (both fabrication and network performance) could be more explicit. M13.1 touches on it, but dedicated metrics might be needed.
        *   A probe specifically asking for **control experiments** performed could strengthen the validation assessment (partially covered in M8.3).
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The line between "Implicit", "Mixed", and "Inferred" can sometimes be blurry, especially when relying on standard physics principles not explicitly stated but necessary for understanding. Clearer examples for each category might help.
        *   The Yoneda Embedding score (M4.7) is highly abstract and likely difficult to apply consistently without specific CT expertise or clearer guidance on *how* to assess "fulfillment" from typical experimental/theoretical physics papers. A simpler "Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity" score with clearer criteria might be more practical.
        *   The distinction between M4 (Self-Organization) and M8 (Emergent Behaviors) could be clarified. M4 seems focused on structure, M8 on function, but overlap exists.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on granularity is needed. Should `SystemNode` be monolithic, or decomposed into constituent parts (ions, walls, fields)? The examples are helpful but consistency is key.
        *   Representing dynamic processes (like adaptation or computation) as nodes (`AdaptationNode`, `ComputationNode`) vs. edges (modifying memory nodes) needs clearer convention.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Assigning scores (0-10) often requires subjective judgment, especially when metrics are qualitative or missing. More detailed rubrics for each score (especially cognitive proximity and Yoneda) would improve consistency. For example, what specifically differentiates a cognitive score of 3 vs 4?
        *   Averaging scores in M13.1 treats all modules equally; weighting might be considered based on relevance to "cognizance". Handling N/A (treated as 0) significantly impacts the average; alternative treatments could be explored (e.g., excluding N/A modules from the average).
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Extracting precise values often requires careful reading and sometimes cross-referencing (e.g., text referencing SM).
        *   Optional sections (M3.4-M3.8, M5.4) sometimes contain important qualitative info even if quantitative values are N/A; ensuring this isn't lost is important. The template handles this reasonably well.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very comprehensive but long. Its strength is its detailed, structured approach. Its weakness is the potential for redundancy and the difficulty of applying highly abstract concepts (like Yoneda) consistently. Streamlining or providing clearer, operationalized definitions for abstract concepts would enhance usability. Conditional sections work well.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Refine the Yoneda probe (M4.7) or replace it with a more operational "Local-Global Mapping Fidelity" score with a clear rubric.
        *   Provide more detailed scoring rubrics for subjective scores (e.g., M9.2, M1.2, M8.2).
        *   Consider adding explicit probes for Stochasticity and Scalability.
        *   Clarify the distinction/relationship between M4 and M8.
        *   Add guidance on node/edge granularity and representation conventions for dynamic processes in M14.
