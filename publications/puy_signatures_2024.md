## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system consists of schools of black neon tetra fish (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) with varying numbers of individuals (N=8, 16, 32, 50) freely swimming in an approximately two-dimensional experimental tank (L=100 cm side, 5 cm water depth). The purpose is to investigate spontaneous behavioral cascades, specifically "turning avalanches," where large directional shifts (measured by turning rate ω derived from velocity and acceleration) propagate through the group. The study analyzes avalanche metrics (duration T, size S, interevent time ti) using tools from statistical physics (criticality, power laws, scaling, data collapse) and seismology (aftershocks, Omori law) to identify signatures of criticality and understand the dynamics and biological function (e.g., collective decision-making) of these events. Fish trajectories were recorded and digitized.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`="Biological Collective", `domain`="Collective Animal Behavior/Statistical Physics", `mechanism`="Behavioral Cascades (Turning Avalanches)", `components`=["Fish (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi)", "Experimental Tank"], `purpose`="Investigate criticality signatures in collective fish behavior"
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The system composition, components, observed phenomena (turning avalanches), analytical methods, and purpose are explicitly described in the Abstract, Introduction (Sec I), Methods (Sec II, Appendix A), and Results sections.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper provides a clear description of the experimental setup (fish species, numbers, tank dimensions, recording), data acquisition (video recording, frame rate, resolution, tracking software), and data processing (trajectory digitization, validation, smoothing, calculation of velocity, acceleration, turning rate ω). Definitions of avalanches (threshold ω_th, duration T, size S, interevent time ti) are precise. Analysis methods (PDFs, power-law fitting, data collapse, aftershock analysis) are detailed. Appendix A provides specific experimental details. Some details about the tracking software's error correction could be slightly more elaborated, but overall clarity is high.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The implementation details are explicitly stated in Section II and Appendices A and B.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Number of Fish (N) | 8, 16, 32, 50 | individuals | Sec II, Appendix A | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Tank Side Length (L) | 100 (exp) / 2730 (pixels) | cm / pixels | Appendix A | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Water Depth | 5 | cm | Appendix A | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Frame Rate | 50 | frames/s | Appendix A | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Turning Threshold (ω_th) | [0.01, 0.3] (range); 0.1, 0.15 (examples); 0.055-0.13 (for fixed r=0.4) | rad/frame | Sec II, Sec III, Sec IV | Explicit | High | N/A |

    *   **Note:** The turning rate ω and its threshold ω_th are derived quantities (Eq. 1, Appendix B) but explicitly defined and used as key parameters for defining avalanches. Pixel units are considered "natural units" in the paper.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy source is the metabolic energy derived from the fish consuming food (external to the experiment's focus). Within the experiment, energy is manifested as kinetic energy for swimming and turning. The paper mentions the "burst-and-coast" mechanism powered by fish muscles (Sec V).
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`="Metabolic (Fish Metabolism/Muscles)", `type`="Chemical/Kinetic"
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper mentions fish muscles powering movement (Sec V) but doesn't quantify metabolic energy input; this is inferred biological context.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: Chemical (metabolic) energy stored in the fish is transduced into kinetic energy for swimming (translational movement) and rotational kinetic energy during turns via muscle contraction. Information transfer (behavioral cascade) could be viewed as a form of energy/signal propagation through the group, but the paper doesn't frame it in terms of physical energy transduction.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`="Muscle Contraction", `from_node`="ChemicalEnergy", `to_node`="KineticEnergy"
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Muscle contraction converting chemical to kinetic energy is basic biology inferred, mentioned briefly in relation to burst-and-coast (Sec V). The paper doesn't detail this transduction process.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not discuss or quantify the energy efficiency of fish swimming, turning, or the propagation of behavioral cascades.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
      *  Justification: No information provided in the text.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Energy is dissipated primarily through hydrodynamic drag as the fish move through the water and internal physiological processes (heat). The "coast" phase of the burst-and-coast mechanism (Sec V) implies energy dissipation due to drag. Quantification is not provided. Qualitative assessment: Medium/High (typical for biological locomotion in fluid).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyDissipationNode`s=['HydrodynamicDrag', 'Heat'], `EnergyDissipationEdge`s from `KineticEnergy` to dissipation nodes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Hydrodynamic drag is inferred as the primary dissipation mechanism for swimming animals. The "coast" phase mentioned in Sec V supports this inference. Heat dissipation is a general aspect of metabolism. Not explicitly analyzed or quantified.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper investigates temporal correlations between avalanches using the concept of aftershocks (Sec VII). The finding of clustered events (Fig 7b) and an Omori law (Fig 7c, Eq 6) describing the decay rate of aftershocks indicates that the occurrence of a previous avalanche (main event/parent) influences the probability of subsequent avalanches (aftershocks) occurring in the near future. This temporal dependence, where the system's past activity affects its future state, constitutes a form of system-level memory. The paper also mentions collective memory in the introduction (Sec I, Ref [13]), though Ref [13] suggests an absence of long-range memory.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The analysis of aftershocks and temporal correlations provides explicit evidence for short-term temporal dependencies (memory). The interpretation as "memory" in the context of the template is implicit, though supported by the paper's methods and findings in Sec VII and context in Sec I.

**(Conditional: If M3.1 is "No", skip to Module 4. If "Yes", include M3.2 and M3.3.)**

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 3
*   Justification: The memory identified relates to the temporal clustering of avalanche events ("aftershocks"). It reflects a short-term persistence of increased system excitability or correlated activity following a significant event. It's not a re-writable memory with distinct states for long-term storage. Retention is relatively short (related to timescale tc ~ 250 frames or Omori decay). Capacity is not defined in terms of distinct states. Read-out accuracy is not applicable in the traditional sense; the 'memory' manifests as an increased probability of subsequent events. It's a dynamic, decaying influence rather than stable information storage.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type, representing the temporally correlated state influencing avalanche probability. Attributes: `type`="TemporalCorrelation/AftershockPersistence".
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    * Justification: The score and justification are based on interpreting the explicitly calculated temporal correlations (Sec VII, Fig 7) within the template's memory framework. The paper does not explicitly score or categorize the memory type.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: ~250 (tc); related to Omori decay `p=2.2`
*    Units: frames
*   Justification: The paper identifies a characteristic timescale `t_c ≈ 250` frames (Fig S6, Sec VII) corresponding to the average time for the school to make a half-turn in the tank. Significant correlations (clustered aftershocks) are observed *below* this timescale (Fig 7b, 7c). The Omori law fit (Eq 6, Fig 7c) with `p = 2.2 ± 0.1` also describes the decay of this influence over time `t_j`. This suggests the memory or influence of a past event decays significantly beyond ~250 frames. Qualitative Descriptor: Short-term.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The timescale `t_c` and the Omori exponent `p` are explicitly calculated (Sec VII, Fig S6, Fig 7c). Interpreting `t_c` as the relevant retention timescale for the observed correlations (memory) is implicit.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute `retention_time_estimate` or `decay_exponent_p` of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: The memory discussed is a temporal correlation effect, not a storage mechanism with a defined number of states or information content.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: The concept is not applicable based on the paper's findings.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: Memory is not "read out" in the traditional sense; it manifests as a statistical increase in event probability. Accuracy is not a relevant metric here.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
       *  Justification: The concept is not applicable based on the paper's findings.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: Related to Omori exponent `p = 2.2 ± 0.1`
    *   Units: N/A (describes decay rate, not % loss per time)
    *   Justification: The Omori law `P(t) = K / (t + c)^p` (Eq 6) describes the decay rate of aftershock probability. The exponent `p = 2.2 ± 0.1` quantifies how quickly the influence of a past event degrades over time `t`. A higher `p` means faster decay.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
            * Justification: The Omori law and exponent `p` are explicitly calculated and discussed in Sec VII and Fig 7c.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `decay_exponent_p` of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper does not discuss the energy cost associated with the temporal correlations or aftershock phenomena.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
*   Justification: Fidelity and robustness metrics for memory are not applicable or discussed in the paper.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper studies collective behavior (schooling, polarization) and emergent phenomena (turning avalanches, scale-free statistics) that arise from the interactions between individual fish without external control dictating the group's structure or dynamics. The avalanches and their statistical properties (power laws, scaling) are emergent features of the group's collective motion. Polarization (Sec VI, Fig 6b) is a global order parameter emerging from local alignment interactions (implicitly assumed, standard in collective motion models referenced).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The phenomena studied (avalanches, scale-free statistics) are explicitly described as emergent collective behaviors. The underlying self-organization process based on local fish interactions is implicitly assumed based on the field's context (Sec I references models of collective motion) and the nature of the system.

**(Conditional: If M4.1 is "No", skip to Module 5. If "Yes", include M4.2-M4.7)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The paper does not explicitly define the local interaction rules between fish (e.g., alignment, attraction, repulsion forces as functions of distance/orientation). It analyzes the *emergent consequences* of these interactions. The rules are implicitly assumed based on standard models of collective motion referenced in Sec I (e.g., Refs [11-14, 27-30]). The definition of an 'active' fish (ω > ω_th) acts as a local rule for avalanche participation, but not the underlying interaction causing the turn. Fish also interact with tank walls (Sec V).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Would define `AdjunctionEdge` between `FishNode`s, representing neighbor interactions. Attributes would include `interactionType` (e.g., alignment, attraction, repulsion, turning response), `range`, `strength`. Need to be inferred from cited literature, not this paper.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Implicit
        *  Justification: The existence of local interaction rules is fundamental to collective motion and implicitly assumed, but the specific rules governing the fish in this experiment are not derived or stated in this paper. Interaction with walls is explicitly studied (Sec V), but rules not formulated.

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A (Local interaction rules are not defined in the paper)

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: Global order emerges in the form of:
        1.  **Polarization (φ):** The degree to which fish align their velocity vectors (Sec VI, Fig 6b). Values range from ~0.5 to ~0.9.
        2.  **Collective Motion:** Coordinated movement of the school as a whole (measured by center-of-mass velocity `v_cm`, Sec V, VI).
        3.  **Statistical Order:** Scale-free (power-law) distributions of avalanche duration (T), size (S), and interevent times (ti), indicating long-range spatiotemporal correlations characteristic of systems near criticality (Sec III, IV, Fig 2, 3). Avalanche shapes also show scaling (Sec IV, Fig 4).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines a `ConfigurationalNode` representing the school's state. Attributes: `polarization`, `v_cm`, `avalanche_statistics_type`="ScaleFree". Could also define `StatisticalOrderNode` linked to `SystemNode`.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: Polarization, v_cm, and the statistical properties (power laws, scaling, data collapse) are explicitly measured, calculated, and discussed as global or collective properties of the system.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: While the precise moment or size of the *next* avalanche is inherently stochastic (characteristic of critical systems), the *statistical distributions* of avalanche properties (T, S, ti) are highly predictable, following robust power laws (Eq 2) and scaling relationships (Eq 3, Eq 4, Fig 4). Data collapses (Fig 3) further demonstrate predictability across different school sizes (N) and thresholds (ω_th) when parameters are appropriately scaled (e.g., fixed activity rate r). The exponents (α, τ, m, γ, p) quantify this statistical predictability. However, predicting the exact trajectory or state of the school at a specific future time point remains challenging due to the stochastic and potentially chaotic nature of the dynamics near criticality.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: The statistical predictability (power laws, scaling, collapse) is explicitly demonstrated. The limited predictability of individual events is implicit context for critical/stochastic systems. The score is a qualitative assessment based on this mix.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Could be an attribute of the `ConfigurationalNode` or `StatisticalOrderNode`, possibly related to the confidence intervals of the scaling exponents.

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** N/A
    *   **Justification:** The paper does not utilize Category Theory concepts like the Yoneda embedding to analyze the local-to-global mapping.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper analyzes information propagation (avalanches) and potential links to collective decision-making, but it does not frame the fish interactions or avalanche dynamics as performing computation intrinsic to the material/system properties in the sense required by the definition (e.g., logic gates, filtering performed by the medium itself). The processing is statistical analysis performed *on* the observed dynamics, not *by* the system as a computation.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: The paper does not make claims about embodied computation.

**(Conditional: If M5.1 is "No", skip to Module 6. If "Yes", include M5.2-5.4)**

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |

    *   **Note:** Durations T, S, ti are stochastic variables characterized by distributions, not single values. tc is an average timescale derived from dynamics.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear/Partial
    *   Justification: The paper links large turning avalanches to collective decision-making processes for selecting a new movement direction (Abstract, Sec V), particularly occurring near minima of the center-of-mass speed during the burst-and-coast cycle (Fig 5c). This suggests the group might be implicitly predicting the need for a direction change (e.g., related to wall avoidance or exploration) and selecting an action (collective turn) to achieve a goal (new direction, avoid collision). Wall interactions promoting large avalanches that reorient the school away from the wall (Sec VI, Fig 6c) also hint at goal-directed behavior. However, the paper does not explicitly frame this within Active Inference, lack evidence for explicit prediction error minimization or detailed internal models. The link to decision-making is more interpretive/biological.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The interpretation in terms of decision-making is explicit, but framing it as Active Inference is an implicit step based on the template's definition, not directly stated or tested in the paper.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** Potential metrics could involve quantifying the change in predictive error (e.g., likelihood of future wall collision) before and after an avalanche, measuring the information-theoretic cost/benefit of turning vs. not turning, or modeling the fish's internal state representation of the environment (tank boundaries, group configuration) and how avalanches update this model. CT-GIN could model the belief propagation during an avalanche.

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper analyzes the statistical properties of spontaneous turning avalanches in established schools. It does not investigate whether the characteristics of these avalanches (e.g., frequency, size distribution, triggering conditions) change over time due to experience or learning within the experimental duration. The focus is on characterizing the system's steady-state (or near-critical) dynamics, not its adaptation or learning process.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        * Justification: The paper does not discuss or provide evidence for adaptive plasticity in the context defined.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The main emergent behaviors described are:
        1.  **Turning Avalanches:** Spatiotemporal cascades where large changes in heading direction (ω > ω_th) propagate through the fish school. These avalanches exhibit variable duration (T) and size (S). (Sec II, III)
        2.  **Scale-Free Statistics:** The distributions of avalanche duration P(T), size P(S), and interevent times P(ti) exhibit power-law scaling over intermediate ranges, suggesting criticality. (Sec III, Fig 2)
        3.  **Scaling Relationships and Data Collapse:** Robust scaling relations exist between T and S (<S>_T ~ T^m), and data collapses are observed for P(T) and P(ti) at fixed activity rates, and for P(ti) normalized by <ti>, and for the avalanche shape n_t. (Sec III, IV, Fig 2c, 3, 4)
        4.  **Temporal Clustering (Aftershocks):** Avalanches tend to occur in clusters, with the probability of observing an "aftershock" avalanche decaying with time according to an Omori-like law following a "main" event. (Sec VII, Fig 7)
        5.  **Collective Turning/Reorientation:** Large avalanches often result in a significant change in the school's overall direction of motion, potentially linked to collective decision-making, especially in response to walls. (Abstract, Sec V, VI, Fig 5b, 6c)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: "TurningAvalanche", "ScaleFreeBehavior", "TemporalClustering", "CollectiveReorientation". Attributes can include scaling exponents (α, τ, γ, m, p).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors and their statistical properties are the main focus of the paper and are explicitly described and quantified.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The scale-free nature and data collapses observed across different school sizes (N=8 to 50) and different turning thresholds (ω_th) suggest the emergent statistical behaviors (power laws, scaling) are robust features of the system, not artifacts of specific parameters (within the ranges studied). The power-law behavior persists even when analyzing only central, non-wall-interacting events (Sec V, Fig S2), indicating robustness against boundary conditions influencing the tails (dragon kings). However, robustness to other perturbations (e.g., environmental noise, individual fish differences, external stimuli not studied here) is not assessed. The system is sensitive to the threshold ω_th (Fig 1b), but the *form* of the scaled distributions appears robust.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Robustness across N and ω_th (via scaling/collapse) is explicitly shown. Robustness to boundary conditions is explicitly tested (dragon king analysis).

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Claims of emergent behaviors (avalanches, scale-free stats, clustering, collective turns) are validated through:
        *   **Operational Definitions:** Clear definitions for avalanches based on turning rate threshold ω_th, duration T, size S, interevent time ti (Sec II).
        *   **Quantitative Analysis:** Calculation of probability density functions (PDFs) for T, S, ti (Fig 2, 3). Measurement of average size vs duration <S>_T (Fig 2c). Calculation of avalanche shapes n_t (Fig 4). Analysis of CM speed, polarization, wall distance during avalanches (Fig 6). Calculation of aftershock statistics, proximity η, rescaled time/space T_j/R_j, Omori law fit (Fig 7).
        *   **Statistical Tests:** Power-law fitting with confidence intervals for exponents α, τ, γ, m (Sec III). Dragon king detection test (p-values given, Sec V, Appendix D). Comparison with null models (randomized data for T_j/R_j in Fig 7b, uncorrelated model in Appendix C).
        *   **Data Collapse:** Demonstrating universal scaling functions by collapsing PDFs for different N or ω_th (Sec IV, Fig 3, 4).
        *   **Reproducibility:** Mention of multiple recordings for each N suggests consistency (Appendix A), although variability between recordings isn't explicitly quantified.
        *   **Limitations:** Finite experiment duration limits the observation range of power laws. Potential influence of tank size (finite-size effects mentioned for tails, Sec III). Limited number of fish (up to 50).
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly describes the quantitative methods, statistical tests, and data analysis techniques used to identify and validate the emergent behaviors.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper maps turning avalanches to "information transfer" (Abstract, Sec I, VIII) and "collective decision-making processes in selecting a new movement direction" (Abstract, Sec V, VIII). It compares avalanche dynamics to phenomena in brain networks (Sec I) and cognitive processes like knowledge creation (Sec VIII). The aftershock analysis is explicitly mapped to seismology concepts (main events, aftershocks, Omori law) (Sec VII). Limitations are implicitly acknowledged by framing findings as "signatures" or "necessary conditions" for criticality, not definitive proof of complex cognition.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `CognitiveMappingEdge` from `BehaviorArchetypeNode`("TurningAvalanche") to `CognitiveFunctionNode`("InformationTransfer", "CollectiveDecisionMaking"). `CognitiveMappingEdge` from `BehaviorArchetypeNode`("TemporalClustering") to `PhysicalPhenomenonNode`("SeismicAftershocks").
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly uses terms like "information transfer," "collective decision-making," and makes comparisons to brain activity and seismology.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates complex collective behavior (Level 2: Sub-Organismal Responsivity) arising from local interactions, showing sophisticated patterns like scale-free avalanches and temporal correlations suggestive of criticality. There are hints of collective decision-making (potentially Level 3: Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy) linked to reorientation, especially near walls. However, the behavior appears primarily reactive to local cues (neighbors, walls) and internal dynamics fluctuations, rather than demonstrating goal-directed planning based on internal models (Level 4), abstract reasoning (Level 6+), or self-awareness (Level 8+). The "information transfer" is passive propagation of a behavioral change, not symbolic communication. While criticality is hypothesized to be relevant for information processing in biological systems, this paper primarily establishes the presence of criticality signatures, not complex cognitive function itself.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is an interpretation based on the observed behaviors described explicitly in the paper, mapped onto the provided CT-GIN Cognizance Scale. The paper itself does not provide such a score.

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper's central theme is the search for and confirmation of signatures of criticality in fish schooling behavior. It explicitly tests for and finds necessary conditions for criticality.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): Avalanche duration exponent (α ≈ 2-3), size exponent (τ ≈ 2), duration-size exponent (m ≈ 1.4), interevent time exponent (γ ≈ 1.6), aftershock decay exponent (p ≈ 2.2).

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This study provides a detailed experimental analysis of turning avalanches in fish schools, identifying robust signatures of criticality. Key strengths lie in the rigorous statistical analysis, demonstrating scale-free behavior (power laws in T, S, ti), scaling relationships (T vs S, avalanche shape), data collapses, and temporal correlations (aftershocks, Omori law). These findings strongly support the hypothesis that fish schools operate near a critical point. However, from a CT-GIN perspective focused on material intelligence, significant limitations exist. The paper focuses on characterizing emergent statistical phenomena rather than the underlying mechanisms of information processing, memory storage (beyond short-term correlations), or adaptation at the material/system level. Energy flow is not considered. Local interaction rules are not defined, hindering a full understanding of the local-to-global mapping. While collective behavior and potential links to decision-making are discussed, the cognitive interpretation remains limited, scoring low on cognitive proximity. Overall, the paper provides valuable data on emergent collective dynamics relevant to criticality but requires significant further work to be fully mapped within a CT-GIN framework of embodied cognition, computation, or adaptive intelligence. Its primary contribution is establishing the presence of complex, critical-like dynamics in a biological collective.

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Model Local Interaction Rules:** Develop or infer explicit mathematical rules governing individual fish interactions (alignment, attraction, repulsion, turning decisions based on neighbors/walls/internal state) that can reproduce the observed avalanche statistics.
        *   **Quantify Information Flow:** Use information-theoretic measures (e.g., transfer entropy) to quantify information propagation during avalanches and assess the efficiency/capacity of this process.
        *   **Mechanism of Temporal Correlation:** Investigate the physical/biological mechanism underlying the observed aftershock correlations (e.g., persistent sensory cues, heightened individual sensitivity post-event, residual spatial structures).
        *   **Test Adaptive Behavior:** Design experiments to test if avalanche statistics or triggering conditions adapt over time or in response to changing environments (e.g., presence of simulated predators, varying tank complexity).
        *   **Link Microscopic Rules to Macroscopic Scaling:** Use CT-GIN or other theoretical frameworks to formally link the (inferred or modeled) local interaction rules to the observed macroscopic scaling exponents and universal functions.
        *   **Explore Computational Capabilities:** Investigate if the avalanche dynamics could potentially be harnessed or interpreted as performing specific computational tasks (e.g., environmental sensing, distributed optimization).
        *   **Study Larger Systems:** Conduct experiments or simulations with significantly larger numbers of fish to better probe the scaling behavior and universality, minimizing finite-size effects.

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A dedicated probe for "Information Processing" (distinct from computation) might be useful, focusing on how information (defined broadly) is represented, transmitted, and transformed within the system, even if not performing formal computation.
        *   Probes specific to biological systems vs. material systems might be needed for clarity, or clearer instructions on how to adapt material-centric terms (like "embodied computation") to biological contexts.
        *   A probe explicitly asking for the *mechanism* linking local rules to global emergent behavior (beyond just describing both) could be added.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Embodied Computation" (M5) and "Information Processing" implied in cognitive functions (M9) or information transfer (M9.1) could be sharper.
        *   The definition of "Memory" (M3.1) is good, but applying it to dynamic correlations vs. static state storage could be clarified with examples in the rubric.
        *   The mapping between CT concepts (Yoneda, Adjunction) and specific system features (M4.7, M4.2 maping) could benefit from more concrete examples or simpler language, especially for non-CT experts.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on mapping statistical distributions or scaling laws (common in physics/biology papers) to GIN attributes or nodes needs clarification. Should exponents be attributes? Should "ScaleFreeBehavior" be a node type?
        *   Mapping implicit rules (like fish interactions) is difficult; clearer instructions on handling inferred components/rules are needed.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Scoring "Cognitive Proximity" (M9.2) and the checklist (M9.3) for non-obviously cognitive systems like fish schools is highly subjective and depends heavily on interpretation and analogy. More objective criteria or anchor points related to specific observable behaviors might help.
        *   Calculating the overall CT-GIN Readiness score (M13.1) was ambiguous based on the description ("Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2"). Specifying exactly *which* numeric scores within those modules (e.g., M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2) are averaged is crucial. Clarify how to handle N/A vs. 0 vs. binary Yes/No answers in the average.
        *   The 0-10 scales would benefit from clearer rubrics or anchor examples for intermediate scores (e.g., what constitutes a '5' in Robustness or Predictability?).
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Mapping statistical findings (distributions, exponents) common in physics papers to the template structure requires interpretation. The template leans more towards systems with clearly defined components and engineered functions.
        *   Extracting information for modules like Energy Flow (M2) or Adaptation (M7) is often impossible for papers not focused on those aspects, leading to many N/As. The template might need conditional visibility based on paper type/focus.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very detailed, which is good for capturing specifics but makes it challenging to apply consistently, especially to systems outside the core domain of engineered "intelligent materials." Applying it to this biological collective motion paper highlighted the need for careful interpretation and resulted in many N/A or implicit fields. Streamlining or providing clearer adaptation rules for different system types could improve usability.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Make the calculation rule for M13.1 explicit (list the exact Vector IDs to average). Handle N/A consistently (e.g., treat as 0 or exclude from average).
        *   Provide clearer examples within the template for CT-GIN mapping, especially for less concrete concepts like statistical order or implicit rules.
        *   Consider adding a field to rate the *strength of evidence* for cognitive mappings (M9.1) or criticality claims (M10.1).
        *   Refine the Cognitive Proximity scale (M9.2) with behavioral anchors relevant across different system types (material, biological, computational).
