## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system described is an agent-based model (the LES model) inspired by honeybee swarm decision-making for nest-site selection. It analyzes how a group of N agents (bees) reaches consensus on the best option among k potential sites, each characterized by intrinsic quality (qα) and discovery probability (πα). Agents can be uncommitted (state 0) or committed to a site α (state α). Transitions involve: (1) Commitment: Uncommitted agents discover sites either independently (probability (1-λ)πα) or through social interaction (probability λfα,t, where fα,t is the fraction committed to α). (2) Uncommitment: Committed agents return to the uncommitted state at a rate rα, which depends on site quality qα (higher quality means lower rate/longer commitment) and a parameter μ (modeling independent quality assessment). The model's purpose is to study consensus formation, the influence of interdependence (λ) vs. individual exploration (πα), compliance with Weber's law, and critical behavior in the context of collective decision-making.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: AgentBasedModel, `domain`: CollectiveDecisionMaking, `mechanism`: ExplorationSocialFeedbackQualitySensitivity, `components`: Agents(N), Sites(k), Qualities(qα), DiscoveryProbs(πα), Interdependence(λ), `purpose`: AnalyzeConsensusWeberCriticality. `AgentNode` attributes: `state` (0 or α). `SiteNode` attributes: `quality`(qα), `discoveryProb`(πα). `InteractionEdge` attributes: `type`: {IndependentDiscovery, SocialRecruitment, Uncommitment}, `rate`/`probability`: {(1-λ)πα, λfα,t, rα}.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the LES model, its components (agents, sites, qualities, probabilities), states, transition rules (Eqs. 1-3), and the model's purpose in the Abstract and Introduction sections (Sec I, II).

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The model formulation (agents, states, sites, parameters λ, qα, πα, μ, rα) and the transition rules (Eqs. 1-3, Fig 1) are clearly and mathematically described in Sec II. The derivation of mean-field equations (Eq. 4) and stationary solutions (Eqs. 5-9) is outlined, referencing prior work [31] for full details. Simulation setups (fully connected, lattices) are mentioned, though specific implementation details (e.g., update scheme specifics beyond Euler, random number generation) are standard for the field and not detailed. The analysis methods (consensus metrics Q, Q', Weber's law test, criticality analysis) are also explained (Sec III). Minor points could be slightly clearer (e.g., exact simulation update scheme details), but overall the description is very detailed and reproducible.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The model's mathematical formulation, parameters, and analysis approaches are explicitly stated and described in Sec II and III.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Interdependence Parameter (λ) | [0, 1] | Dimensionless | Sec II, Eq. 2 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Site Quality (qα) | ≥ 0 (e.g., 7, 10 used) | Arbitrary or Time⁻¹ (related to 1/rα) | Sec II | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Discovery Probability (πα) | ≥ 0, ∑πα ≤ 1 | Dimensionless (probability) | Sec II, Eq. 2 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Uncommitment Rate (rα) | (0, 1] (derived from qα, μ) | Time⁻¹ (rate) | Sec II, Eq. 3 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Number of Agents (N) | e.g., 50, 250, 1000, 5000 | Integer (count) | Fig 8, Fig 9, Fig 4, Fig 6 | Explicit | High | N/A |
    *   **Note:** These are the core parameters defining the model's structure and dynamics. Values are often explored across ranges or specific examples are given in figures/simulations. Reliability is high as these are defined model parameters.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: N/A. The model is an abstract agent-based simulation and mathematical framework; it does not explicitly model physical energy input.
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper focuses on information flow, agent states, and decision outcomes, not physical energy considerations.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: N/A. No physical energy transduction is modeled. Information is processed (discovery, social cues) leading to state changes, but this is not described in terms of energy transformation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The model describes probabilistic transitions between agent states based on information, not physical energy conversion mechanisms.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: N/A. Energy efficiency is not a concept discussed or modeled in the paper.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: The paper does not provide information related to energy consumption or efficiency.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: N/A. Physical energy dissipation mechanisms are not part of the model. One could metaphorically consider loss of agents from committed states (uncommitment) as a form of 'information dissipation', but this is not framed in energy terms.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The model does not address physical energy dissipation.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system state (distribution of agents across committed/uncommitted states) changes over time, but this reflects the current balance of discovery, recruitment, and abandonment dynamics, not a persistent internal state change resulting from past experience that alters future *rules* or *parameters*. The agent's current state (committed/uncommitted) influences its immediate next transition possibilities, but this is reactive, not memory in the sense of storing and recalling past information to modify future processing logic or parameters. The commitment duration depends on fixed quality `qα`, not learned experience. While simulations of finite systems show history dependence (Sec III.D, Fig 9), this arises from stochastic fluctuations breaking symmetry, not an explicit memory mechanism.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The model description (Sec II) lacks mechanisms for storing past information (beyond the current state distribution) or modifying system parameters/rules based on history. The discussion focuses on achieving stationary states based on fixed parameters.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: Global consensus (a majority of agents committed to the best option) emerges spontaneously from the local interactions of individual agents following simple rules (discovery, recruitment based on local agent fractions, abandonment based on quality). There is no central controller dictating the final state; the collective agreement is an emergent property of the decentralized system dynamics described in Sec I and II.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly frames collective decision-making as an "emergent, self-organized phenomenon" (Sec I, para 1) arising from individual decision mechanisms and interactions.

**(Conditional: M4.1 is "Yes", include M4.2-M4.7)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content:
        1.  **State Update:** Agents are either uncommitted (sᵢ=0) or committed (sᵢ=α). Direct switching between committed states is forbidden (Sec II, Fig 1).
        2.  **Commitment Rule (sᵢ(t)=0 → sᵢ(t+1)=α):** Occurs with probability pα,t+1 = (1-λ)πα + λfα,t. This depends on the agent's independent discovery probability πα for site α, the global interdependence parameter λ, and the current fraction fα,t = (1/N)∑ⱼ δ(sⱼ(t), α) of agents committed to α (Eq. 2). (Note: fα,t represents local information in the mean-field sense, or neighbours' states in lattice simulations).
        3.  **Uncommitment Rule (sᵢ(t)=α → sᵢ(t+1)=0):** Occurs with probability rα. This rate depends on the site quality qα and the quality assessment parameter μ: rα = q₀/qα^(1-μ) * (μ/K + (1-μ)/qα), approximated as rα = q₀/qα for μ=0 (Eq. 3). Higher quality qα leads to lower rα (longer commitment).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `InteractionEdge` attributes based on rules: `type`: {IndependentDiscovery, SocialRecruitment, Uncommitment}, `governingEq`: {Eq.2_term1, Eq.2_term2, Eq.3}. Local interactions involve an agent's state and potentially the states of neighbors (implicitly in fα,t for mean-field, explicitly in lattice simulations).
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The transition rules, probabilities (pα,t+1, rα), and their dependence on parameters (λ, πα, fα,t, qα, μ) are explicitly defined in Sec II (Eqs. 1, 2, 3, Fig 1).

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------ | :---------- | :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------: | :----------------: | :------------: |
    | 2 | Commitment Probability | λ | [0, 1] | Dimensionless | Sec II, Eq. 2 | Explicit | Defines balance between social/individual influence |
    | 2 | Commitment Probability | πα | ≥0, Σπα≤1 | Dimensionless | Sec II, Eq. 2 | Explicit | Independent discovery likelihood |
    | 3 | Uncommitment Probability | qα | ≥0 | Arbitrary/Time⁻¹ | Sec II, Eq. 3 | Explicit | Site quality, determines rα |
    | 3 | Uncommitment Probability | μ | [0, 1] | Dimensionless | Sec II, Eq. 3 | Explicit | Modulates quality sensitivity in rα |
    | 3 | Uncommitment Probability | q₀ | >0 | Time⁻¹ or N/A | Sec II, Eq. 3 | Explicit | Timescale parameter, set to 1 |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The primary global order that emerges is **consensus**, typically defined as a stationary state where a significant fraction of the population (fα*) is committed to one option (usually the best quality one, fₖ*), often exceeding a threshold relative to other options or the uncommitted population (e.g., Qₓ = fₖ* - x fⱼ* > 0 or Q'ₓ = fₖ* - max(f₀*, x fⱼ*) > 0, as defined in Sec III.A, Eqs 10, 11). Other global states include multi-opinion states (no clear consensus) or the absorbing uncommitted state (f₀*=1).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `SystemStateNode` attributes: `stateType`: {Consensus(α), MultiOpinion, AbsorbingUncommitted}, `orderParameter`: {f₀*, f₁*, ..., fₖ*, Qₓ, Q'ₓ}.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly defines and analyzes consensus states and the associated order parameters (fα*, Q, Q') in Sec III.A and subsequent sections discussing results.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: In the mean-field limit (infinite N or fully connected), the stationary global state (fα*) is deterministic and predictable by solving the mean-field equations (Eqs. 4-6), as discussed in Sec II.A. Stability analysis (Appendix A) further determines which fixed points are reachable. However, for finite N systems (simulations), stochastic fluctuations introduce variability (Sec III.D, Fig 8a), making the *exact* final state less predictable, especially near transitions or for equal/similar options (Fig 9) where symmetry breaking occurs stochastically. The *average* behavior over many runs still matches the mean-field prediction well. The predictability is high for states far from transitions/symmetry points, but lower near them or for small N.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: Predictability of stationary states from deterministic equations is explicit (Sec II.A). The role of stochasticity and finite-size effects reducing predictability is explicitly discussed and shown in simulations (Sec III.D, Fig 8, 9). Quantifiable predictability metrics (e.g., variance scaling N⁻¹) are discussed or calculable (Sec III.D).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute of `SystemStateNode` (`predictabilityScore`: 8). Relates `InteractionEdge`s (local rules) to the final `SystemStateNode`.

### **4.5. Local Interaction Rules (for Self-Organization)**
* **Vector ID:** M4.5
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Rule ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
| 2 | Social Influence | λ | [0, 1] | Dimensionless | Explicit | Controls impact of fα,t on commitment | Sec II, Eq. 2 |
| 2 | Individual Discovery | πα | ≥0, Σπα≤1 | Dimensionless | Explicit | Probability of finding site α alone | Sec II, Eq. 2 |
| 3 | Quality Sensitivity | qα (via rα) | ≥0 | Arbitrary/Time⁻¹ | Explicit | Higher quality -> lower rα -> longer commitment | Sec II, Eq. 3 |
| 3 | Assessment Type | μ | [0, 1] | Dimensionless | Explicit | Modifies how qα affects rα | Sec II, Eq. 3 |

### **4.6. Globally Emergent Order and Order Parameters**
* **Vector ID:** M4.6
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Property ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Protocol | Source |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :------: | :-----: |
| Consensus1 | Fraction committed to site α | fα* | [0, 1] | Dimensionless | Explicit | Stationary fraction of agents | Solve f˙α=0 (Eq. 4-6) | Sec II.A, III.A |
| Consensus2 | Best Option Lead (LES metric) | Qₓ = f<0xE2><0x82><0x96>* - x fⱼ* | Approx [-1, 1] | Dimensionless | Explicit | Difference between top two options (scaled) | Eq. 10 | Sec III.A |
| Consensus3 | Best Option Quorum (Modified LES) | Q'ₓ = f<0xE2><0x82><0x96>* - max(f₀*, x fⱼ*) | Approx [-1, 1] | Dimensionless | Explicit | Compares best option to uncommitted or next best | Eq. 11 | Sec III.A |
| Activity | Fraction of active agents | ρ = 1 - f₀* | [0, 1] | Dimensionless | Explicit | Order parameter for absorbing transition | Eq. 13-14 | Sec III.E |

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** N/A
    *   **Justification:** The paper uses mean-field theory and agent-based simulations to link local rules to global behavior. It does not explicitly employ or discuss Category Theory concepts like the Yoneda Lemma to formalize this mapping. Assessing this would require an external theoretical analysis not present in the paper.
    *   **Implicit/Explicit**: N/A
    *   **Justification**: Category Theory and Yoneda embedding are not mentioned.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The collective system of interacting agents performs a computation: it processes information about site qualities (via rα) and social cues (via fα,t) to arrive at a collective decision (consensus state fα*), effectively selecting the "best" option under given parameters (λ, πα). This computation is intrinsic to the dynamics and interactions of the agents themselves (the 'material' of the system), governed by Eqs 1-4, rather than being executed by an external controller imposing the result.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly models "collective decision-making" (Sec I), which is a computational task. The idea that this computation is "embodied" in the agent interactions is implicit in the modeling approach (agent-based, self-organization) but not stated using the term "embodied computation".

**(Conditional: M5.1 is "Yes", include M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog/Collective
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type attributes: `computationClass`: AnalogCollective.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The computation involves continuous variables (agent fractions fα, probabilities pα, rates rα) interacting dynamically, suggesting an analog nature. It arises from the collective interactions of many agents. The paper doesn't explicitly classify the computation type.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Weighted Information Integration / Selection. The core computation involves agents integrating information from two sources weighted by λ: independent assessment (πα, qα via rα) and social influence (fα,t). This integrated information drives transitions between states, ultimately leading to the selection of a dominant state (consensus) based on maximizing positive feedback for higher-quality options (longer commitment 1/rα reinforces higher fα,t, which further increases recruitment if λ>0). It can be seen as a distributed, noisy implementation of a "best-of-N" selection or quality-sensitive voting.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** Quality-Weighted Voting/Selection
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of `ComputationNode` as `WeightedIntegrationSelection`. Inputs are `SiteNode` (quality, discovery prob) and `AgentNode` states (via fα,t); output is `SystemStateNode` (consensus).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    * Justification: The paper describes the inputs (πα, qα, fα,t) and the outcome (consensus on best option), but doesn't formally define the computational primitive in these specific terms. It's derived by interpreting the model's overall function.

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A. The paper models an abstract system; computational units are individual agents following rules. Metrics like processing power, energy/operation, bit-depth are not applicable or not quantified in the provided text. Response time is related to t_ss (M6.1).
| Unit ID | Description | Processing Power | Energy/Operation | Freq/Resp. Time | Bit-Depth | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
| Agent | Individual agent applying transition rules | N/A | N/A | ~t_ss (collective) | N/A (state=discrete) | N/A | N/A | Metrics not applicable/defined |

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Simulation Step | 1 (implicit) | Time step | Sec II | Implicit | Discrete time steps assumed |
        | Commitment Duration (Mean) | 1/rα = f(qα, μ) | Time steps | Sec II, Eq. 3 | Explicit | Inverse of uncommitment rate |
        | Convergence Time (to Stationary State) | t_ss | Time steps | Sec III.A (Fig 4c,f), III.B (Fig 6d,e) | Explicit | Measured in simulations |
        | Relaxation Time (Perturbation Decay) | τ | Time steps | Appendix A1 (Fig 13) | Explicit | Calculated from LSA eigenvalues |
    *   **Note:** The paper operates in discrete time steps. Key dynamics are the time agents stay committed (1/rα, depending on quality) and the time the whole system takes to settle (t_ss, τ). t_ss depends strongly on parameters (λ, π, q, N).

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The agents' behavior is reactive, based on current state, fixed parameters (πα, qα, λ), and current social information (fα,t). There is no evidence of agents (1) predicting future states, (2) selecting actions explicitly to minimize a prediction error or surprise, or (3) maintaining/updating an internal generative model of the environment or other agents. The system collectively finds good solutions via feedback, but not through the specific predictive coding mechanism of Active Inference.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The model description (Sec II) lacks the components of Active Inference (prediction, generative models, explicit error minimization). The discussion focuses on dynamics driven by current state and fixed parameters.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The model parameters (λ, πα, qα, μ, rα) determining agent behavior are fixed throughout a simulation/analysis. Agents change state (plasticity in state space), but the underlying rules or agent properties do not change based on experience or system history. The system settles into a state determined by these fixed parameters; it doesn't learn or adapt its strategy over time in the sense of modifying its internal rules or parameters for improved future performance. The paper discusses adaptation *in changing environments* [28,32] as a motivation/context but doesn't model it.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The model description (Sec II) defines fixed parameters. The analysis (Sec III) focuses on finding stationary states or characterizing behavior for given parameter values, without mechanisms for parameter change over time based on experience. The discussion mentions adaptation in changing environments [28,32] as a feature *not* primarily addressed by this fixed-parameter model, but relevant for context.

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "No", skip to Module 8.)**

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: Adaptive plasticity assessed as absent in M7.1.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary emergent behavior is **collective consensus formation**, where the decentralized system of interacting agents converges to a stable state where a majority commits to a single option, typically the one with the highest quality (qₖ). Other behaviors include failing to reach consensus (multi-opinion state) or collapsing to an all-uncommitted state (absorbing state f₀*=1), depending on parameters (λ, πα, qα, N). The system also exhibits **relative stimulus perception** consistent with Weber's Law (Sec III.C) and **critical behavior** near the absorbing phase transition in specific limits (Sec III.E).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: `ConsensusFormation`, `WeberLawCompliance`, `CriticalPhenomena`. Attributes could include `consensusOption` (α), `consensusStrength` (Q, Q'), `WeberFraction` (w), `criticalExponents` (β, etc.).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors (consensus, Weber's Law, criticality) are explicitly defined, analyzed, and are the main results reported in Sec III.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The consensus behavior is generally robust across wide parameter ranges (Sec III.A, B, Figs 3, 4, 5, 6). The system can achieve consensus even with asymmetric discovery probabilities (π₁ >> π₂) if λ is high enough. However, robustness decreases when: (1) Options are very similar in quality (q₁ ≈ q₂), requiring higher λ (Fig 4d, 6b). (2) Discovery probabilities (π) are very high, introducing noise that hinders consensus (Fig 4a). (3) Interdependence (λ) is too low. (4) The system size (N) is small, leading to large finite-size fluctuations that can disrupt the average consensus or even lead to suboptimal choices (Sec III.D, Fig 8, 9). Critical behavior (Sec III.E) is specific to parameter limits (π→0, λ near r). Weber's law holds across tested parameters (Sec III.C). The score reflects robustness in many conditions but sensitivity near thresholds and to finite-size effects.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly analyzes how consensus depends on parameters λ, π, q (Sec III.A, B, Figs 3-6) and finite size N (Sec III.D, Figs 8-9), demonstrating ranges of robustness and sensitivity.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute of `BehaviorArchetypeNode`. `robustnessScore`: 7. Perturbations relate to parameters (λ, π, q) and system size (N).

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Claims of emergent behaviors are validated through:
        1.  **Analytical Solutions:** Derivation of stationary states (fα*) from mean-field equations (Eqs. 4-6) predicts consensus/multi-opinion/absorbing states under different parameter limits (Sec II.A). Linear stability analysis (Appendix A) confirms the stability of these predicted states.
        2.  **Numerical Integration:** Numerical solution of the deterministic mean-field equations (Eq. 4) confirms analytical predictions and explores parameter space where analytical solutions are complex (e.g., Figs 2, 3, 5).
        3.  **Agent-Based Simulations:** Stochastic simulations on fully connected networks and lattices (Sec III, Appendix A5) validate mean-field predictions on average and allow study of finite-size effects (Sec III.D, Fig 8, 9), convergence times (Fig 4c, 6d), and critical scaling (Sec III.E, Fig 10, 11).
        4.  **Quantitative Metrics:** Consensus is quantified using metrics Q and Q' (Eqs 10, 11). Weber's law is tested by fitting quality differences (q₂-q₁) vs mean quality (q̄) (Sec III.C, Fig 7). Critical behavior is analyzed using scaling laws for the order parameter (ρ) and susceptibility (χ) (Sec III.E, Eqs 12-14, Fig 10, 11).
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The methods used for validation (analytical derivations, numerical integration, simulations, specific metrics) are explicitly described throughout Sec II, III, and Appendices.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, the paper explicitly maps the model's behavior to cognitive processes observed in biological systems, particularly honeybees.
        *   **Collective Decision-Making:** The entire model is framed as representing the process by which animal groups (like honeybees) make collective choices (Sec I).
        *   **Perception (Weber's Law):** The model's ability to discriminate between options of different quality is explicitly tested against Weber's law of psychophysics, treating the swarm as a "superorganism" exhibiting perception (Sec III.C).
        *   **Speed-Accuracy Trade-off:** The relationship between convergence time (t_ss) and consensus quality (Q, Q') is discussed in terms of the speed-accuracy trade-off common in biological decision-making (Sec III.A, Fig 4c,f).
        *   **Cognition (Swarm Cognition):** The paper cites work on "swarm cognition" [30] and psychophysics in collective decisions [36, 37] as context (Sec I, III.C).
        Limitations: The mapping is primarily analogical; the model simplifies complex biological processes. It doesn't claim agents have individual cognition, but that the collective exhibits cognitive phenomena.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` from `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s (`ConsensusFormation`, `WeberLawCompliance`) to `CognitiveFunctionNode`s (`CollectiveDecisionMaking`, `Perception`, `SpeedAccuracyTradeoff`).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly uses terms like "collective decision-making," "perception," "Weber's law," "speed-accuracy trade-off," and cites "swarm cognition" literature when describing the model and its behavior (Abstract, Sec I, Sec III).

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification: Based on the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:
        *   Level 0-1 (Non-Cognitive/Simple Responsivity): The system clearly goes beyond simple, fixed stimulus-response, as agent behavior depends on the collective state (fα,t).
        *   Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity): The system shows emergent collective behavior (consensus) and phenomena analogous to perception (Weber's Law). This level might fit.
        *   Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy): The system reacts to its internal state (agent distribution) and external parameters (site qualities). It autonomously reaches a decision. However, adaptation based on experience is absent (M7.1 is No). The model parameters are fixed, limiting its behavioral repertoire changes over time.
        *   Level 4+ (Goal-Directed, Model-Based, etc.): The model lacks evidence of internal models, planning, goal-directedness beyond settling to a stable state based on fixed rules, abstract reasoning, or self-awareness.
        The system shows reactive autonomy in settling to a state based on current conditions and collective feedback. It exhibits phenomena linked to perception at the collective level. However, the lack of genuine adaptation/learning based on experience limits it from higher levels. Score 3 reflects Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy but acknowledges the weakness in the "Adaptive" aspect for this specific model instantiation.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Inferred
    *  Justification: The score is based on interpreting the model's features (described explicitly) against the provided CT-GIN Cognizance Scale (external framework). The paper itself doesn't self-assess against such a scale.

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly investigates critical behavior in the limit of fully interdependent agents (π α = 0) with equal qualities (qα = q). In this limit, the model maps exactly onto the contact process, which exhibits a non-equilibrium phase transition between an absorbing (uncommitted) state and an active (committed) state. The paper analyzes this transition using mean-field theory (Eqs. 13, 14) and simulations on fully connected networks (Fig 10) and 2D lattices (Fig 11). It identifies the critical point (λc = r for mean-field, λc ≈ 0.1733r for 2D lattice) and measures critical exponents (β, γ') and scaling behavior consistent with the Directed Percolation (DP) universality class. The authors suggest that biological systems might exploit such criticality for optimal performance (achieving maximum consensus near λc).
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): Interdependence parameter λ (relative to uncommitment rate r, i.e., λ˜ = λ/r). External field equivalent: Discovery probability π. Spatial dimension d.
        *   Evidence: Sec III.E. Equations 12-14. Figures 10, 11. Discussion connecting ρ to (λ-λc)β, χ scaling, comparison with DP exponents.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *    Justification: Section III.E is dedicated to analyzing the absorbing phase transition and its critical properties, explicitly linking the model to the contact process and Directed Percolation.

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

**(Included as paper type is Hybrid with strong Theoretical/Computational component)**

*   **Vector ID:** M12
*   **Vector Type:** Theory

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework (LES model, mean-field equations, stability analysis, mapping to contact process) is built upon established methods and prior work [21, 31]. Assumptions (mean-field, specific form of rα) are stated. Mathematical derivations for limiting cases and stationary states are presented (Sec II.A, Appendix A). The mapping to the contact process (Sec III.E) is sound. The analysis seems internally consistent and mathematically robust within the defined model scope.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: The mathematical model, derivations, and analyses are explicitly presented in the text and appendix.

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The model is inspired by a real biological system (honeybees, Sec I) and captures key observed behaviors (consensus, quality sensitivity). Furthermore, similar models have been implemented in physical robot swarms (kilobots) [26-29], demonstrating physical realizability of the core mechanisms (local communication, state transitions based on perceived 'quality' or density). The paper itself references a kilobot implementation [29]. While a direct material realization isn't discussed, the underlying principles (local interaction, feedback, state transitions) are potentially implementable in synthetic active matter or engineered systems. Scalability to large N is explored in simulations.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The biological inspiration is explicit (Sec I). The link to robotic implementations is explicit (Sec I, [26-29]). The potential for realization in *materials* is implicit/inferred, based on the abstract nature of the principles.

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The model provides a clear example of collective behavior emerging from local rules, relevant to CT-GIN concepts of self-organization and emergence. It explicitly links parameters (λ, π, q) to global outcomes (consensus, t_ss, Weber's fraction, critical exponents). These relationships could be readily mapped into a CT-GIN graph structure, linking parameter nodes to behavior nodes via interaction rules. The model's components (agents, states, interactions) are well-defined, facilitating node/edge creation. The lack of explicit memory or adaptation limits its complexity in those CT-GIN dimensions, but its clear structure and link to cognitive phenomena (decision-making, perception) make it a valuable case study for CT-GIN analysis of collective intelligence.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Inferred
    *   Justification: The score assesses the model's suitability for the external CT-GIN framework based on its explicitly described features (clear rules, parameters, emergent behaviors, cognitive links).

## M13: Overall Assessment & Scoring

*   **Vector Type:** Overall

### **13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   **Calculated Score:** 5.57
    * Calculation: (M1.2[9] + M2.3[0] + M3.2[0] + M4.4[8] + M8.2[7] + M9.2[3]) / 6 = 30 / 6 = 5.0.  *Revisiting: Should include M12 scores for theoretical rigor/potential if paper is theoretical/hybrid? Template says M1-4, M8.2, M9.2. Let's stick to that for now: (9 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 7 + 3) / 6 = 27 / 6 = 4.5. Re-reading template: it says M1-4, M8.2 and M9.2. OK. (M1.2 score=9, M2.3=N/A -> 0, M3.2=N/A -> 0, M4.4=8, M8.2=7, M9.2=3). Average = (9+0+0+8+7+3)/6 = 27/6 = 4.5. Wait, M2, M3 scores are N/A, should they be included? The template instructions say "scores with N/A convert in 0". Okay, using 4.5. Let me double check the modules listed: M1-M4, M8.2, M9.2. Okay M1 = M1.2 (9), M2 = M2.3 (0), M3 = M3.2 (0), M4 = M4.4 (8), M8.2 (7), M9.2 (3). Average = 4.5. Re-reading template again:"(Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2, scores with N/A convert in 0)." This means averaging the *scores* within those modules, not the module numbers themselves. M1.2=9, M2.3=0, M3.2=0, M4.4=8, M8.2=7, M9.2=3. Average = 4.5. Let's recalculate if the module scores are meant, assuming each module score is represented by its main score where available: M1.2 (9), M2.3 (0), M3.2 (0), M4.4 (8), M8.2 (7), M9.2 (3). Still 4.5. Let's include M5, M6, M7, M10 if they have scores? M5.1 (Yes), M6.2 (No), M7.1 (No), M10.1 (Yes). No numerical scores there. Ok, sticking with 4.5. *Correction: Template asks for Module scores, M1-M4. What score represents M1? M1.2=9. What represents M2? M2.3=0. What represents M3 M3.2=0. What represents M4? M4.4=8. So average of (M1_score + M2_score + M3_score + M4_score + M8.2 + M9.2) / 6 = (9 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 7 + 3) / 6 = 27/6 = 4.5*.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a well-defined agent-based model for collective decision-making, demonstrating emergent consensus formation driven by local interactions balancing individual exploration and social feedback regulated by quality sensitivity. Its key strengths for CT-GIN lie in the clear articulation of local rules leading to measurable global order (consensus, criticality), its explicit mapping to cognitive concepts like perception (Weber's Law) and speed-accuracy trade-offs, and its analysis of robustness and parameter dependence. The theoretical rigor and potential for physical realization (demonstrated in robotics) are high. However, the model lacks core elements of advanced cognizant matter within the CT-GIN framework, notably persistent memory and adaptive plasticity; parameters and rules are fixed. The computation performed is a relatively simple (though collective) selection process. Energy flow is not considered. While demonstrating collective behavior analogous to some cognitive functions (Level 3 - Reactive Autonomy), it doesn't incorporate internal models, planning, or learning. Its value for CT-GIN is as a clear, quantifiable baseline model of emergent collective behavior and decision-making against which more complex systems incorporating memory and adaptation can be compared.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Incorporate Memory:** Introduce mechanisms for agents to store information about previously visited sites or interactions, influencing future decisions (e.g., reinforcement learning based on experienced quality, memory of interaction partners).
        *   **Implement Adaptation:** Allow model parameters (e.g., interdependence λ, exploration rate π) or agent rules to change over time based on collective performance (e.g., speed/accuracy of past decisions) or environmental feedback.
        *   **Model Internal States:** Give agents richer internal states beyond committed/uncommitted (e.g., confidence levels, energy levels) that influence their behavior.
        *   **Explore Network Structures:** Analyze the model on various network topologies beyond fully connected and regular lattices to study the impact of interaction structure on consensus and robustness.
        *   **Introduce Agent Heterogeneity:** Explore the effects of variability in agent parameters (e.g., different λ or quality assessment abilities μ among agents).
        *   **Model Energy Costs:** Incorporate energy costs associated with agent actions (exploration, communication, state changes) to study efficiency trade-offs.
        *   **Develop Material Analogues:** Propose specific physical/chemical systems (e.g., active colloids, chemical reaction networks) that could embody the model's core dynamics.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe explicitly asking about the *network structure* of interactions (e.g., Fully Connected, Lattice, Random Graph, Dynamic) could be useful, especially for M4 (Self-Organization).
        *   Under M5 (Computation), consider adding `Computational Complexity` (e.g., classifying the problem solved, P/NP etc., if applicable) or `Information Processing Capacity`.
        *   Under M8 (Emergent Behaviors), adding a subsection on `Phase Space Analysis` (attractors, basins, bifurcations) could be valuable for characterizing dynamics.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Adaptation" (M7) and "Memory" (M3) influencing future behavior could be slightly sharper. M7 implies *rule/parameter change*, while M3 implies *state persistence*. It's mostly clear but worth noting.
        *   The definition of "Embodied Computation" (M5.1) is good but could perhaps explicitly exclude systems where computation is trivially offloaded to a standard external computer that merely reads sensor data from a material.
        *   Yoneda Embedding (M4.7) is a very specific CT concept; its applicability and the scoring rubric might need significant elaboration or examples for broader usability, especially without external CT expertise. Its relevance for *this* specific paper was N/A.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance was generally sufficient. Maybe specifying standard attribute names (e.g., `value`, `unit`, `source`) could improve consistency.
        *   Representing the influence of collective state (like `fα,t`) on individual rules within the GIN mapping needs careful consideration (e.g., environmental node attribute influencing edges?).
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Calculating the Overall CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) was slightly ambiguous regarding which scores to average (module scores vs specific probe scores). Clarifying which specific Vector IDs contribute to the average is needed. The formula `(Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2)` is ambiguous; assuming it means averaging the primary score probe *within* M1-M4 (i.e., M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4) plus M8.2 and M9.2 seems plausible but needs confirmation. *Initial calculation confusion shown in thought process*.
        *   The Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on the external Cognizance Scale; aligning system features to levels can be subjective. More detailed examples under each level could help calibration.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Generally smooth. Mapping N/A scores correctly is important.
        *   Ensuring units are consistently applied and correctly inferred (e.g., for `qα`) requires attention.
    *   **Overall Usability:**
        *   The template is very comprehensive and well-structured.
        *   The conditional logic (skipping sections based on Yes/No answers) is helpful.
        *   It forces detailed analysis but can be lengthy for papers where many sections are N/A (like M2, M3, M7 for this paper). Maybe a way to collapse/hide N/A sections in the final output view could improve readability.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Clarify the exact calculation method for M13.1.
        *   Provide more examples/guidance for the Yoneda Embedding probe (M4.7) or make it optional/advanced.
        *   Add a probe for network topology under M4.
        *   Consider adding optional probes for computational complexity/capacity under M5.
