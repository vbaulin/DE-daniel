## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system described is a class of architected materials called Mechanical Neural Networks (MNNs). MNNs are lattices composed of interconnected tunable beams joined at nodes. The stiffness of these beams can be actively tuned via closed-loop control using voice coils (actuators) and strain gauges (sensors). The purpose of the MNN is to learn desired mechanical behaviors (e.g., shape morphing, specific responses to loads) by adjusting beam stiffness values, analogous to how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) tune weights. The paper demonstrates this concept experimentally with a 2D lattice of 21 tunable beams, showing its ability to learn two different shape-morphing behaviors using optimization algorithms (GA and PPS) to minimize the error between measured and target output node displacements under specific input loading conditions. The system also explores the effect of parameters like lattice size, configuration, algorithm type, number of behaviors, and stiffness linearity on learning performance through simulation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType='ArchitectedMaterial'`, `domain='Mechanics'`, `mechanism='TunableStiffnessBeams_ActiveControl'`, `components=['TunableBeams', 'Nodes', 'Actuators(VoiceCoils)', 'Sensors(StrainGauges)', 'Controller(Microcontroller,OpAmps)', 'Frame', 'InputLoadActuators', 'OutputMeasurementSensors(Cameras/StrainGauges)']`, `purpose='LearnMechanicalBehaviors'`
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The core description of MNNs, their components (beams, nodes), purpose (learning behaviors), and the analogy to ANNs are explicitly stated. The specific components used in the experimental setup (voice coils, strain gauges, controller components, GA/PPS) are also explicit. The consolidation into a single description involves implicitly linking these stated parts.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper provides a good level of detail on the MNN concept, the tunable beam design (Fig. 2, Materials and Methods), the experimental setup (Fig. 3, Materials and Methods), the control loop (Fig. S2A), and the learning process. Fabrication details, calibration procedures (Fig. S2 B-E), and optimization algorithms (Materials and Methods) are described. Simulation details and verification are also included (Materials and Methods, Fig. S11, S12). Some minor details might require reference to supplementary materials (e.g., specific electronic component models beyond main ones), but overall, the implementation is clearly presented and reproducible in principle.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The score is based on the explicit descriptions, figures, and methods provided throughout the main text and supplementary materials referenced.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy source is electrical power supplied to the control electronics, which drive the voice coil actuators within each tunable beam and the input loading actuators. Mechanical energy is also input via forces applied to the input nodes during the learning and behavior execution phases.
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A (Electrical: Watts/Joules; Mechanical: Joules)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source=['ElectricalPowerSupply', 'MechanicalLoading']`, `type=['Electrical', 'Mechanical']`
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The use of voice coil actuators, controllers, and power supplies (Fig. S3, Materials and Methods) explicitly requires electrical energy. The application of input forces (Fig. 1B, Fig. 4A) explicitly requires mechanical energy input. Quantifying the exact input is not done.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: 1. Electrical to Mechanical: Electrical energy is converted into mechanical force/displacement by the voice coil actuators in the tunable beams and the input loading system. 2. Mechanical to Electrical: Mechanical strain in the beams' flexures is converted into electrical signals by the strain gauges. 3. Electrical (Signal) Processing: Electrical signals from sensors are processed by the microcontroller and amplifiers to compute control signals. 4. Mechanical (Internal): Input mechanical forces are transmitted through the lattice structure (beams and nodes), causing deformations and storing/releasing elastic potential energy.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism='Electromechanical(VoiceCoil)'`, `from_node='ElectricalEnergy'`, `to_node='MechanicalEnergy'`; `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism='Piezoresistive(StrainGauge)'`, `from_node='MechanicalStrainEnergy'`, `to_node='ElectricalSignal'`; `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism='ElectronicComputation'`, `from_node='ElectricalSignal'`, `to_node='ElectricalControlSignal'`; `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism='ElasticDeformation'`, `from_node='InputMechanicalEnergy'`, `to_node='StoredElasticEnergy'`
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The components involved (voice coils, strain gauges, electronics) explicitly define the types of transduction (electrical-mechanical, mechanical-electrical, electrical signal processing). The transmission of forces and deformation within the lattice is an explicit part of its mechanical nature. The detailed tracing is implicit based on component functions.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: The system relies on active control with voice coils and extensive electronics (amplifiers, microcontrollers) for each of the 21 beams plus input actuators. Voice coils are generally not highly efficient, and the continuous operation of the control loops likely leads to significant electrical energy consumption relative to the mechanical work performed during behavior manifestation or learning steps. The paper does not provide quantitative efficiency metrics, but the active nature strongly suggests low overall energy efficiency compared to passive materials. Qualitative assessment: Low.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `efficiency='Low'` of relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s (e.g., Electrical to Mechanical).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: The paper does not quantify efficiency. The low score and justification are inferred based on the described components (active control, voice coils, electronics) and general knowledge of their energy consumption characteristics.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: 1. Electrical Resistance (Joule Heating): In voice coils, wiring, and electronic components (resistors, transistors in amplifiers). Likely significant due to active control currents. (Qualitative: High). 2. Mechanical Friction/Damping: Internal material damping in the flexures (aluminum, strain gauges) and potentially minor friction in joints (though designed to be minimized). (Qualitative: Low-Medium, design targets minimal friction/hysteresis, Fig S10). 3. Acoustic Noise: Minor dissipation from vibrating components. (Qualitative: Low). 4. Control Overhead: Energy consumed by sensing, computation (microcontroller), and signal amplification, regardless of mechanical output. (Qualitative: High). The paper mentions hysteresis as a factor to minimize for successful learning (Fig. S10), implying awareness of mechanical dissipation, but doesn't quantify these losses.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode`s (e.g., `JouleHeating`, `MechanicalDamping`) and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s linking `EnergyInputNode` or `EnergyTransductionEdge`s to these nodes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper does not explicitly list or quantify dissipation mechanisms. These are inferred based on the physical components described (voice coils, electronics, flexures) and general physics principles. The mention of minimizing hysteresis provides an indirect reference to mechanical dissipation.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system utilizes the tuned axial stiffness values of the constituent beams as its memory. The optimization algorithms adjust these stiffness values based on minimizing the error between desired and actual output displacements under training loads. Once set, these stiffness values persist (maintained by the active control system) and determine the MNN's response to future loading scenarios, thus influencing future behavior based on past training (experience). This fits the definition of memory as a change in system state (beam stiffnesses) that persists beyond the immediate training stimulus and influences future behavior.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The paper explicitly states that beam stiffness values are tuned like ANN weights and that these values determine the learned behaviors (Fig. 1, Introduction, Results). It explicitly mentions storing a "mechanical 'muscle memory'" (Introduction, Tunable beams section) as a desirable feature, although the current implementation relies on active control to maintain stiffness. The interpretation of this tunable stiffness as the system's memory in the cognitive science sense is implicit.

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 5
*   Justification: The memory is embodied in the physical stiffness parameters of the beams. It is actively maintained (requiring continuous power) rather than passively stored in the material structure itself in this implementation. The memory state (stiffness values) is continuously variable within a range [-2, 2.3 N/mm]. It's readable (influences mechanical response) and writeable (updated by optimization algorithms). Capacity depends on the number of beams and the precision of stiffness control. Retention relies entirely on the active control system being powered. Compared to passive material memory (phase change, plasticity) it lacks inherent persistence but offers active tunability. Compared to digital memory, it's analog. It facilitates learning (adaptation) but doesn't closely resemble biological memory types. The score reflects the active, tunable, but non-persistent (without power) nature.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type with attributes like `mechanism='TunableBeamStiffness'`, `persistence='ActiveControlDependent'`, `encoding='Analog'`.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The mechanism (tunable stiffness) is explicit. The characteristics (active, analog, range) are explicitly described or measured (Fig. 2). The score and comparison to other memory types are based on interpreting these explicit facts within a broader memory classification framework, making it implicit.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: Dependent on continuous power supply
*    Units: s (potentially indefinite if powered)
*   Justification: The stiffness values (memory state) are maintained by the active closed-loop control system. As long as the system is powered and the controllers are active, the stiffness values are held. If power is lost, the beams revert to their passive stiffness (1.81 N/mm mentioned in simulation verification). Therefore, retention is not an intrinsic material property timescale but depends entirely on the operational status of the external control system.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The paper doesn't state a retention time but explicitly describes the active control mechanism responsible for maintaining stiffness. The dependence on continuous power is inferred from this description.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute `retentionTime='ActiveControlDependent'` of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: N/A (depends on precision)
*   Units: N/A (potentially bits if discretized)
*   Justification: The memory is analog (continuous stiffness values within a range). Capacity could be defined by the number of beams (21 in the experiment) multiplied by the effective resolution or number of distinguishable stiffness levels each beam's controller can reliably maintain. The paper does not quantify this resolution. Theoretically, it's high, but practically limited by sensor noise, control loop stability, and actuator precision.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The number of beams is explicit. The analog nature is explicit. The capacity in terms of distinguishable states or bits is not discussed or quantified, requiring inference about control precision limits.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `capacity='Analog_Nbeams*Resolution'` of the `MemoryNode`, where Nbeams=21 (exp.) and Resolution is unspecified.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A (related to MSE)
*   Units: N/A (potentially % error or displacement error in mm)
*   Justification: Memory readout occurs implicitly when the MNN responds to a load; the resulting deformation reflects the stored stiffness values. Readout accuracy could be indirectly assessed by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) achieved during learning (e.g., 0.006 mm² for GA, 0.063 mm² for PPS in Fig. 4 B,C), which measures how accurately the system reproduces the target behavior based on the stored stiffnesses. However, this is an accuracy measure of the learned behavior, not directly of reading the stiffness values themselves. The paper does not quantify the accuracy of the stiffness control itself (how close the actual stiffness is to the setpoint Kp, although Fig 2C shows good correlation).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
       *  Justification: MSE values are explicit measures of learning performance/behavior accuracy. Interpreting this as a proxy for memory readout accuracy is implicit. Direct quantification of stiffness control accuracy vs setpoint is not provided.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `readoutAccuracyProxy='MSE_Behavior'` of `MemoryNode` or related `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: As memory relies on active control, degradation isn't a primary factor like material fatigue or charge leakage. Potential degradation modes would be component failure (electronics, actuators, sensors) or control loop instability over time, which are not characterized in terms of a rate. If power is lost, the 'memory' is instantly lost (beams revert to passive stiffness).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
            * Justification: Inferred from the active control mechanism. The paper doesn't discuss degradation rates.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `degradationMode='ComponentFailure/PowerLoss'` of the `MemoryNode`.

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Stiffness Update (Write) | N/A | N/A | J or W | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Energy cost not quantified. Involves computation (algorithm step) and potentially minor actuator adjustment. Depends heavily on algorithm step complexity. |
    | Stiffness Maintenance (Hold) | N/A | N/A | W | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Energy cost not quantified. Involves continuous sensing, computation, and actuator current to maintain stiffness against disturbances or internal forces. Likely the dominant cost. |
    | Behavior Execution (Read) | N/A | N/A | W | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Energy cost not quantified. Energy consumed during mechanical response under load, primarily for stiffness maintenance by actuators. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: The paper does not quantify the energy cost associated with memory operations (writing/updating stiffness, maintaining stiffness, or executing behavior based on stored stiffness). Costs are inferred qualitatively based on system operation.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | Stiffness Accuracy | How closely actual beam stiffness matches the setpoint (Kp) | Good correlation shown, not quantified | N/A | Attribute of `MemoryNode` | Fig. 2C | Mixed | Figure shows correlation visually, but quantitative error metric absent. |
    | Learning Accuracy (MSE) | Mean Squared Error between target and actual output displacements after learning | GA: 0.006, PPS: 0.063 (exp, 2 behaviors) | mm² | Attribute of `BehaviorArchetypeNode` / `AdaptationNode` | Fig. 4 B,C | Explicit | Explicitly measured and reported results. |
    | Robustness to Noise | Ability to maintain stiffness/behavior despite system noise | Noise mentioned as affecting MSE plots | N/A | Attribute of `MemoryNode`/`BehaviorArchetypeNode` | Discussion (re Fig. 4 B,C) | Mixed | Noise effect observed explicitly, quantification absent. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
*   Justification: Learning accuracy (MSE) is explicit. Stiffness accuracy is shown graphically but not quantified (implicit value). Robustness to noise is mentioned qualitatively (mixed).

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system's structure (lattice connectivity) is pre-designed and fixed. The desired global behaviors (shape morphing) are explicitly defined targets. The learning process uses global optimization algorithms (GA, PPS) that evaluate the overall system performance (MSE based on output nodes) to adjust local parameters (beam stiffnesses). While the specific *combination* of stiffness values that achieves the target behavior is found through this process and might be considered emergent in the sense of not being explicitly pre-calculated, the global order (target shape) is externally imposed, and the process is guided by global error minimization, not purely local interaction rules leading to spontaneous global patterns.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper describes a pre-designed lattice and targeted learning using global optimization. The conclusion that this does not constitute self-organization according to the provided definition (spontaneous emergence of global order from *local* rules without external control defining global structure) is an interpretation based on the explicit description.

**(Conditional: If M4.1 is "No", skip to Module 5. If "Yes", include M4.2-M4.7)**

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Partial
    *   Justification: The MNN performs computation in the sense that it maps input forces/displacements to output displacements based on its learned internal state (stiffness values), analogous to an ANN. This mapping is physically embodied in the mechanical structure's response. However, the *learning* process itself (calculating MSE, running GA/PPS algorithms, determining stiffness updates) relies heavily on external computation (the controller/computer running the optimization algorithm). The paper contrasts MNNs with morphological computation/reservoir computing where the body's dynamics are used as a computational resource, suggesting MNNs lean more towards embodying the learned function (the ANN forward pass) rather than the entire learning process. The physical lattice computes the mechanical response given the stiffnesses, but an external system computes the stiffness updates.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The analogy to ANN computation and the physical mapping of inputs to outputs are explicit. The reliance on external computation for the learning algorithm (optimization) is also explicit (Materials and Methods description of GA/PPS). The "Partial" assessment balances these aspects based on the definition of embodied computation.

**(Conditional: If M5.1 is "No", skip to Module 6. If "Yes", include M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog / Neuromorphic
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type, `computationType=['Analog', 'Neuromorphic']`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *    Justification: The paper explicitly describes MNNs as mechanical *analogs* to ANNs (Fig. 1B caption). The components (beams as weights, nodes as neurons) and function (mapping inputs to outputs via tunable parameters) directly emulate neural network concepts, making it neuromorphic. The physical quantities (force, displacement, stiffness) are continuous, making the computation analog.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Weighted Summation and Propagation (implicit physical equivalent). Each node sums the forces transmitted by the connected beams (whose contribution is weighted by their stiffness). This resulting net force/displacement state is propagated through the lattice. While there isn't an explicit activation function like in ANNs, the physics of force balance and material deformation at the nodes serves an analogous role in transforming and propagating signals through the layers. The fundamental operation is the linear elastic response of the interconnected beam network, mapping input forces/displacements to output displacements based on the stiffness matrix (influenced by tunable Kp values).
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode` as `WeightedSumPropagation (PhysicalAnalog)`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    * Justification: The paper draws the analogy to ANN weights and neurons but doesn't explicitly define the computational primitive in mathematical terms like "weighted sum" or "activation function." This is inferred from the physical description (force balance at nodes, stiffness determining force transmission) and the ANN analogy.

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Unit ID | Description | Processing Power | Energy/Operation | Freq/Resp. Time | Bit-Depth | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
| Beam (Weight) | Represents a tunable connection weight via its stiffness | N/A | See M3.7 (Hold/Update Cost) | N/A (Static stiffness, but control loop has dynamics) | Analog | N/A (Conceptual) | Implicit | Role as weight analog is explicit, performance metrics are not. |
| Node (Neuron) | Junction point integrating forces/displacements from connected beams | N/A | N/A | N/A (Governed by lattice dynamics) | Analog | N/A (Conceptual) | Implicit | Role as neuron analog is explicit, performance metrics are not. |
| MNN Lattice (Network Forward Pass) | Physical computation of output displacements given input forces and beam stiffnesses | N/A (Maps input vector to output vector) | See M3.7 (Execution Cost) | Governed by mechanical response time (likely ms range) | Analog | N/A (Conceptual) | Implicit | Function is explicit, performance metrics are not. Response time depends on structure/damping. |

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Learning Time (Experiment, GA) | 111.13 | hours | Discussion | Explicit | Explicitly stated learning duration. |
        | Learning Time (Experiment, PPS) | 2.68 | hours | Discussion | Explicit | Explicitly stated learning duration. |
        | Learning Algorithm Step (PPS, Experiment) | ~10 steps to convergence | N/A | Fig. 4C (Count dots) | Explicit | Number of MSE reduction steps shown. Duration per step N/A. |
        | Learning Algorithm Step (GA, Experiment) | 40 generations | N/A | Materials and Methods (re Fig. 4B) | Explicit | Number of generations stated. Duration per generation N/A. |
        | Stiffness Control Loop | N/A (Implicitly fast enough for quasi-static assumption) | s / ms | N/A | Implicit | Assumed fast, but not specified. Related to K_d setting. |
        | Mechanical Response Time | N/A (Implicitly quasi-static) | s / ms | N/A | Implicit | Experiments appear quasi-static; dynamic response not characterized. |
    *   **Note:** Learning times are very long. Control loop and mechanical response times are not specified but are likely much faster (ms range typical for such actuators/structures).

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system does not appear to exhibit active inference. While it adapts based on minimizing error (MSE), this error is calculated based on predefined target displacements provided externally. There is no evidence of the system generating internal predictions of sensory input, comparing them to actual input to calculate surprise/prediction error based on an internal generative model, or selecting actions/stiffness changes specifically to minimize this future prediction error according to such a model. The learning is supervised (target outputs provided) and driven by standard optimization algorithms, not an active inference loop.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The learning process description (minimizing MSE against fixed targets using GA/PPS) is explicit. The assessment that this does not meet the criteria for active inference is an interpretation based on the definition.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system explicitly changes its internal structure (beam stiffness values) in response to experience (training cycles involving applying loads, measuring outputs, calculating error). This change persists (while powered) and leads to improved performance (lower MSE, closer match to target behaviors) over time. This constitutes adaptive plasticity, where the system learns to perform specific tasks better through iterative adjustments based on performance feedback.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The paper explicitly describes the learning process where beam stiffnesses are tuned via optimization algorithms (GA, PPS) to minimize the MSE, leading to the MNN learning desired behaviors (Results, Fig. 4). This is the definition of adaptation in this context.

**(Conditional: If M7.1 is "No", skip to Module 8. If "Yes", include M7.2)**

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The adaptation mechanism involves updating the axial stiffness values (Kp parameter in the controller) of the tunable beams based on optimization algorithms (Genetic Algorithm or Partial Pattern Search). The process is: 1. Apply predefined input load(s). 2. Measure resulting output node displacements (using strain gauges indirectly, validated by cameras). 3. Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between measured and target output displacements. 4. The optimization algorithm (GA or PPS, running on an external controller) uses the MSE as a cost function and proposes new sets of stiffness values (within the allowed range [-2, 2.3 N/mm]) intended to reduce the MSE. 5. The controllers update the beam stiffnesses to these new values. This loop repeats until the MSE is minimized below a threshold or the algorithm terminates. GA uses population-based evolution and crossover, while PPS performs a directed search around the current stiffness values.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `AdaptationNode` type and `Monad` edges. `mechanism='OptimizationAlgorithm (GA/PPS)'`, `target='MinimizeMSE'`, `parameters='BeamStiffness (Kp)'`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The adaptation mechanism, including the use of GA and PPS, calculation of MSE, measurement via strain gauges, and tuning of beam stiffness (Kp), is explicitly detailed in the Results and Materials and Methods sections.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary functional behavior demonstrated is *learned shape morphing*. Specifically, the MNN lattice learns to displace its output nodes to predefined target positions (forming specific shapes, e.g., sinusoidal contours in Fig. 1B, specific displacements in Fig. 4A) in response to specific, predefined input loading conditions (e.g., horizontal forces, vertical shear forces). The system learns to simultaneously achieve multiple such input-output mapping behaviors. Simulations also explore learning randomly generated shape-morphing behaviors.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`. `behaviorType='LearnedShapeMorphing'`, `input='AppliedForces/Displacements'`, `output='NodeDisplacements'`, `mechanism='TunedLatticeStiffnessResponse'`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: The paper explicitly defines the goal as learning mechanical behaviors like shape morphing (Introduction, Results) and demonstrates learning specific target displacements (Fig. 1B, Fig. 4A) experimentally and simulated random behaviors (Fig. 5).

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 4
    *   Justification: Robustness is not extensively tested. The discussion mentions noise affecting MSE measurements during learning (Fig. 4 B,C), suggesting some sensitivity. The paper *claims* MNNs can relearn if damaged or reconfigured (Introduction), but this is not experimentally demonstrated. The reliance on active control makes the behavior completely non-robust to power failure. Robustness to variations in input loading (magnitude, direction) beyond the specific training scenarios is not evaluated. Robustness depends heavily on the accuracy and stability of the many individual control loops. Failure of a single beam controller could significantly impact global behavior. The low score reflects the dependence on active control and lack of experimental validation for robustness claims (damage, reconfiguration).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper makes claims about potential robustness (Introduction) but doesn't provide supporting experimental evidence. Sensitivity to noise is mentioned explicitly but not quantified. The dependence on power is inferred from the active control design. The overall robustness assessment is therefore implicit and based on the system's described architecture and lack of validation tests.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: This score contributes to the reliability attributes of the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`. `robustnessScore=4`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: The primary behavior (learned shape morphing) is validated experimentally by comparing measured output node displacements to target displacements under specific input loads after the learning process has converged. Quantitative validation is provided via Mean Squared Error (MSE) plots showing convergence over time/iterations (Fig. 4 B, C, D). Initial and final displacement plots visually compare achieved vs. target positions (Fig. 4 B, C). The indirect measurement of output displacements via strain gauges is validated against direct camera measurements (Fig. S6). Simulations further validate the concept for larger lattices and different conditions (Fig. 5). Limitations include validation on only two specific behaviors experimentally, potential influence of uncharacterized noise, and lack of validation for robustness claims (damage tolerance, reconfiguration).
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The validation methods (MSE calculation, comparison of measured vs. target displacements, simulation results, sensor validation) are explicitly described and presented in figures and text (Results, Discussion, Supplementary Materials).

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper explicitly maps the MNN system to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). MNNs are described as "mechanical analogs to ANNs" (Fig. 1B caption). The tunable beams are directly analogous to ANN weights, and the nodes where beams connect are analogous to neurons (Fig. 1B). The process of tuning beam stiffness to achieve desired input-output mappings is presented as analogous to training an ANN by tuning weights. The term "learn behaviors" is used throughout, mapping the adaptation process to learning in a cognitive sense. The concept of "mechanical 'muscle memory'" is also mentioned, mapping the stored stiffness state to a form of memory.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge`. Source: `SystemNode`, Target: `CognitiveFunctionNode(ANN)`; Source: `ComponentNode(Beam)`, Target: `CognitiveFunctionNode(Weight)`; Source: `ComponentNode(Node)`, Target: `CognitiveFunctionNode(Neuron)`; Source: `AdaptationNode`, Target: `CognitiveFunctionNode(Learning)`; Source: `MemoryNode`, Target: `CognitiveFunctionNode(Memory)`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly draws analogies between MNN components/processes and ANN components/processes (Introduction, Fig. 1, Results).

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy). It clearly adapts its behavior (stiffness tuning) based on experience (training iterations) and feedback (MSE minimization) to improve performance on specific tasks (shape morphing). It operates within a predefined structural context and learns specific input-output mappings provided by external targets. It does not show evidence of internal models, prediction, goal generation, or other hallmarks of higher cognitive levels (Levels 4+). The ANN analogy is strong at the structural/functional mapping level, but the underlying mechanisms (physical mechanics vs. abstract mathematics, external optimization vs. internal learning rules) differ significantly, limiting deeper cognitive parallels.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is assigned based on interpreting the explicitly described system capabilities (adaptation, learning specific tasks via optimization) against the provided CT-GIN Cognizance Scale.

**CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:**

*   **Level 0: Non-Cognitive:** Purely reactive system. No internal state beyond immediate stimulus-response.
*   **Level 1: Simple Responsivity:** Basic stimulus-response behavior. Reactions are fixed and predetermined.
*   **Level 2: Sub-Organismal Responsivity:** Behavior exhibits basic forms of adaptation or plasticity, but lacks complex representation or goal-directedness.
*   **Level 3: Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy:** System adapts its behavior based on experience and feedback, but within a limited behavioral repertoire.
*   **Level 4: Goal-Directed/Model-Based Cognition:** System exhibits goal-directed behavior based on internal models of the world, allowing for planning and flexible action selection.
*   **Level 5: Contextual/Relational Cognition:** System understands and responds to relationships between objects, events, and concepts.
*   **Level 6: Abstract/Symbolic Cognition:** System can manipulate abstract concepts and symbols, enabling logical reasoning and problem-solving.
*   **Level 7: Social Cognition:** System exhibits social intelligence, understanding and interacting with other agents.
*   **Level 8: Metacognition/Self-Awareness:** System possesses awareness of its own internal states and cognitive processes.
*   **Level 9: Phenomenal Consciousness:** System exhibits subjective experience (qualia). (Currently theoretical for material systems)
*   **Level 10: Sapience/Self-Reflective Consciousness:** System possesses self-awareness, understanding of its own existence, and ability for complex abstract thought. (Currently theoretical for material systems)

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper introduces Mechanical Neural Networks (MNNs), a compelling hybrid experimental/computational system demonstrating machine learning principles embodied in an architected material. Its key strength lies in the clear demonstration of adaptive plasticity (M7.1=Yes), where beam stiffnesses are tuned via optimization algorithms (GA/PPS) to learn specific shape-morphing behaviors (M8.1), achieving good accuracy (low MSE). The explicit analogy to ANNs provides a strong cognitive mapping (M9.1=Yes), placing the system at Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy) on the cognizance scale. However, significant limitations exist from a CT-GIN perspective. Energy efficiency is likely very low due to active control (M2.3=2). Memory relies entirely on active control for persistence (M3.3). The system lacks self-organization (M4.1=No) and relies heavily on external computation for learning (M5.1=Partial). Robustness is claimed but not experimentally validated and likely low due to active control dependence (M8.2=4). Overall, MNNs represent a significant step in physically embodying ANN concepts for material function but remain far from fully autonomous, self-organizing, or energy-efficient cognizant matter. Potential lies in exploring passive tunable elements and more embodied learning rules.

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Passive Memory/Stiffness Tuning:** Investigate materials or mechanisms allowing beam stiffness to be set and maintained passively (e.g., phase change materials, bistable mechanisms, non-volatile mechanical memory) to improve energy efficiency and robustness.
        *   **Embodied Learning Rules:** Explore implementing learning rule calculations locally within the material structure (e.g., using mechanical logic or local feedback), reducing reliance on external computation.
        *   **Quantify Energy & Efficiency:** Measure electrical energy consumption during learning and operation; calculate energy efficiency for specific tasks. Quantify dissipation sources.
        *   **Characterize Dynamics:** Measure control loop bandwidth and mechanical response times. Analyze system behavior under dynamic loading conditions.
        *   **Validate Robustness:** Experimentally test system performance under noise, component failure (beam controller failure), damage (beam removal), and varying environmental conditions.
        *   **Explore Self-Organization:** Design MNN architectures or local interaction rules that could lead to emergent structure or behavior adaptation without explicit global targets.
        *   **Increase Behavioral Complexity:** Train and test MNNs on more diverse and complex tasks beyond simple shape morphing (e.g., vibration damping, specific wave propagation, mechanical computation).
        *   **Quantify Memory Capacity/Fidelity:** Determine the practical resolution of stiffness control and quantify the resulting memory capacity and readout fidelity.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A dedicated section/probe for quantifying the *degree of embodiment* vs. external control for functions like memory, computation, and adaptation could be useful. Currently distributed across justifications (e.g., M3.1, M5.1).
        *   A probe for assessing the *modularity* and *scalability* of the design implementation.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The line between "Implicit" and "Mixed" justification can be blurry. Perhaps clearer guidelines or examples are needed.
        *   The definition of "Computational Primitive" (M5.3) could be expanded with more examples, especially for non-standard computation types.
        *   The Yoneda Embedding section (M4.7) seems highly theoretical and might be difficult to apply consistently without more specific guidance or rubric, especially for experimental papers not framed in CT terms. Its relevance/practicality could be clarified.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   More explicit examples of how to represent complex interactions (e.g., feedback loops in adaptation M7.2) in the GIN mapping would be helpful.
        *   Guidance on node granularity (e.g., should a whole controller be one node, or its sub-components?)
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Scoring robustness (M8.2) and cognitive proximity (M9.2, M9.3) remains subjective. While the scale helps, more concrete behavioral anchors for each score level would improve consistency.
        *   Calculating the overall CT-GIN readiness score (M13.1) needs a precise, ideally automated formula (e.g., simple average of specified scores, potentially weighted). The current instruction is slightly ambiguous ("scores with N/A convert in 0"). Clarity on which scores are included is essential. The auto-calculation note conflicts with manual calculation.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Extracting quantitative data for optional sections (e.g., M3.4-M3.8) is rare. Consider making them clearly optional or providing alternative qualitative descriptors.
        *   Mapping the detailed textual descriptions (e.g., M1.1, M7.2) accurately into structured CT-GIN attributes requires care; perhaps standardized attribute lists for common node types could assist.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is extremely comprehensive but demanding. Balancing detail with usability is key. Some sections felt slightly redundant (e.g., multiple tables asking for similar parameters in M4). Maybe consolidate parameter tables per module. The conditional logic is good but adds complexity.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Clarify the calculation method for M13.1 and ensure consistency between the instruction and the "Calculated Score" field (perhaps remove the manual calculation instruction if it should be automated).
        *   Provide a detailed rubric or specific examples for scoring M4.7 (Yoneda), M8.2 (Robustness), and M9.2/M9.3 (Cognitive Proximity).
        *   Consider adding a "Scalability/Modularity" score or subsection.
        *   Streamline parameter tables within modules where appropriate.
        *   Add "N/A" as an explicit option alongside Explicit/Implicit/Mixed where applicable (e.g., for scores if the whole section is skipped).
