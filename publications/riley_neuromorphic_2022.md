*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system is a neuromorphic metamaterial designed for mechanosensing and associative learning. It comprises a multistable metamaterial sheet made of bistable dome units (3D printed TPU) embedded with piezoresistive sensors (conductive PLA). These units filter, amplify, and transduce mechanical inputs above a threshold force into electrical resistance changes. These signals program flexible, non-volatile polymeric memristors (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Cu) which store sequences of spatially distributed mechanical inputs as analogue resistance states. The memristor array is configured to physically embody a Hopfield network, where memristance changes correspond to updating synaptic weights based on Hebbian learning rules triggered by dome inversions. The system's purpose is to demonstrate embodied mechanosensing, memory, and online learning of spatial patterns, mimicking tactile perception and associative memory without supervised training or significant external overhead. It learns applied patterns and allows their retrieval from the final memristor states.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Neuromorphic Metamaterial, `domain`: Mechanosensing/Embodied AI, `mechanism`: Bistability/Piezoresistivity/Memristance/Hopfield Network, `components`: ['TPU Domes', 'PLA Sensors', 'PEDOT:PSS Memristors', 'Control Circuitry'], `purpose`: Associative Learning/Pattern Recognition from Mechanical Inputs. Edges: `MechanoElectricalEdge` (Dome -> Sensor), `SignalProcessingEdge` (Sensor -> Amplifier/Switch), `ElectricalMemoryEdge` (Switch -> Memristor), `HopfieldNetworkEdge` (Memristor <-> Memristor via XOR/Weight calculation logic).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The core components, mechanisms (bistability, piezoresistivity, memristance, Hopfield network), and overall purpose (mechanosensing, memory, learning) are explicitly stated in the Abstract and Introduction. The precise nature of the control circuitry (amplification, switching, XOR logic for Hopfield weights) is detailed partly in the text and more fully in the Supplementary Information (Figures S7, S16), requiring integration of information.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper clearly describes the fabrication of the mechanosensing units (materials, 3D printing, sensor embedding) and the memristors (materials, fabrication steps). The experimental setup for characterizing unit cell behavior (mechanical testing, resistance measurement) and the memristor programming scheme (voltage pulses, amplification circuit) are well-explained, often referencing detailed figures and supplementary information (e.g., Figs 2, 3, S1-S14). The Hopfield network implementation logic (XOR gate interaction capture, matrix construction) is described conceptually and detailed in the SI (Figs 4, S15-S17). Some specific details of the integration circuit (OpAmp models, resistor values selection) are in the SI, requiring careful reading. Overall, the implementation is largely clear and reproducible, though requiring access to the SI for full detail.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: Key aspects of fabrication, experimental setup, and the conceptual basis of the Hopfield network are explicit. Fine details of the electronic circuits and specific component choices (e.g., OpAmp model, resistor selection logic) are explicit in the SI but require integration, making the overall clarity assessment mixed based on the main text alone, but high when SI is included.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The system uses two primary energy inputs:
        1.  Mechanical energy: Applied force/pressure to invert the bistable domes.
        2.  Electrical energy: DC voltage sources for powering the sensor readout circuit, the signal amplification/switching circuit, and the memristor programming/reading pulses. Specific voltages mentioned include 2V for sensor reading, 5V for the switch regulator output/memristor writing, 1.5V for memristor reading, and 4.3V for Hopfield training pulses.
    *   Value: Mechanical: Force ≥ F_th (e.g., 18 N, 22 N depending on geometry); Electrical: 1.5, 2, 4.3, 5 V
    *   Units: Mechanical: N; Electrical: V
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `MechanicalInputNode`: attributes - `type`: Force/Pressure, `threshold`: F_th; `ElectricalInputNode`: attributes - `type`: Voltage, `source`: DC Power Supply/Function Generator, `level`: [1.5, 2, 4.3, 5 V].
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Mechanical force thresholds (18 N, 22 N) are explicitly mentioned (Fig 2e). Electrical voltage values for different operations (sensor readout 2V, memristor writing/Hopfield training 5V/4.3V, memristor reading 1.5V) are stated in the Methods, Results (Spatiotemporal Memory, Hopfield networks), and SI (Figs 4b, S7, S8).

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: 1. Mechanical to Mechanical/Strain: Applied force above threshold causes dome snap-through (potential energy release) leading to strain in the surrounding membrane. 2. Mechanical/Strain to Electrical Resistance: Strain in the membrane changes the resistance of the embedded piezoresistive sensor. 3. Electrical (Resistance Change) to Electrical Voltage: The sensor resistance change alters the voltage drop across it in a voltage divider circuit, which is then amplified and used to trigger a switch regulator. 4. Electrical (Voltage Pulse) to Electrochemical/Resistance Change: Voltage pulses above V_th applied to the PEDOT:PSS memristor induce electrochemical changes (likely related to ion migration/redox reactions involving Cu/ITO electrodes and the polymer) that alter its resistance state non-volatily.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `MechanoMechanicalEdge` (Force -> Dome State): mechanism: Bistable Snap-Through; `MechanoElectricalEdge` (Dome State -> Sensor Resistance): mechanism: Piezoresistivity; `ElectricalSignalProcessingEdge` (Sensor Resistance -> Switched Voltage): mechanism: Voltage Divider/Amplification/Switching; `ElectricalMemoryEdge` (Switched Voltage -> Memristor Resistance): mechanism: Voltage-Activated Resistive Switching (Electrochemical).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes mechanical snap-through (Fig 2), piezoresistive sensing (Fig 2c,e), the use of amplification and switching to process sensor signals for memristor programming (Section: Spatiotemporal Memory, Fig S7), and the voltage-controlled resistive switching of the memristors (Fig 3b, Section: Spatiotemporal Memory).

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification/Metrics: Efficiency is not explicitly calculated or discussed. The system relies on active components (amplifiers, regulators, power supplies) and involves resistive elements (sensors, memristors, series resistors), suggesting significant energy loss as heat. The mechanical actuation requires forces on the order of ~20N. Memristor programming uses relatively long pulses (5s) at several volts (4.3-5V), which, while potentially low power compared to CMOS for *parallel* computation, is not inherently energy-minimal per operation in absolute terms for this specific implementation. The comparison to event cameras suggests *potential* for power efficiency due to thresholding, but this is not quantified. Qualitative Assessment: Low-Medium. The thresholding nature avoids constant sensing power drain, but the active electronics and writing process likely consume non-trivial energy.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `efficiency` (qualitative: Low-Medium) of `MechanoElectricalEdge`, `ElectricalSignalProcessingEdge`, `ElectricalMemoryEdge`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: Efficiency is not calculated. The assessment is based on implicit understanding of the components used (amplifiers, resistors, long voltage pulses) and general knowledge about energy dissipation in such systems. The paper mentions power efficiency only in comparison to event cameras (Introduction) but provides no data for this system.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Major dissipation mechanisms include: 1. Mechanical Damping/Viscoelasticity: Energy loss during dome snap-through and material deformation (TPU stress-softening mentioned, Fig S2). 2. Joule Heating: Resistive losses in piezoresistive sensors, memristors (especially in LRS), series resistors (R_s), and wiring. 3. Electronic Component Losses: Energy consumed by Op-Amps in the amplification circuit (Fig S7) and the switch regulator. 4. Electrochemical Side Reactions: Potential parasitic reactions during memristor programming. Quantification is not provided. Qualitative Assessment: Medium-High (due to active electronics, resistive elements, and potentially inefficient mechanical/electrochemical processes).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode`(type: Heat, Mechanical Damping, Electrochemical Loss). `EnergyDissipationEdge` from `DomeNode`, `SensorNode`, `MemristorNode`, `AmplifierNode`, `SwitchNode` to corresponding `EnergyDissipationNode`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper does not explicitly quantify dissipation. The mechanisms listed (damping, Joule heating, electronic losses) are inferred based on the physical nature of the components described (viscoelastic TPU, resistors, Op-Amps, memristors). Stress-softening (Fig S2) implies mechanical energy loss.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system incorporates two forms of memory:
        1.  Structural Memory: The bistable domes retain their state (ground or inverted) after the force is removed, representing a 1-bit memory of whether the threshold force was exceeded. This state change affects the sensor resistance (Fig 2d, e).
        2.  Electrical Memory: Non-volatile memristors store analogue resistance values that represent the cumulative history of dome inversion events (specifically, pair-wise interactions in the Hopfield network implementation). The memristor state persists after power removal and influences the behavior of the Hopfield network (pattern retrieval) (Figs 3, 4).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The paper explicitly describes the bistability of the domes as a form of memory encoding (Section: Filtering and Thresholding, Fig 2d, e) and the use of non-volatile memristors to store sequences of mechanical inputs (Abstract, Introduction, Section: Spatiotemporal Memory, Fig 3), referring to them as providing a "means to store spatially distributed mechanical signals" and "electrical memory".

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 6
*   Justification: The system combines bistable structural memory (1-bit, non-volatile but single write unless reset mechanically) and analogue non-volatile memristive memory. The memristors demonstrate multi-state capability (incremental programming shown in Fig 3c, d) and non-volatility (Fig 3b i-v curve). They are used to implement associative memory (Hopfield network). Retention time is implied to be long (non-volatile), but not quantified over extended periods. Capacity is demonstrated for learning a small set (p=3 unique, 4 total presented) patterns in a 2x2 array (Fig 4). Readout accuracy is indirectly assessed via Hopfield network performance (91% retrieval accuracy mentioned). The programming involves relatively long pulses (5s) and shows some variability (Fig S10, S13). Write endurance/cycles are mentioned for stability (Fig S11) but not extensively quantified. The score reflects the presence of non-volatile, analogue memory used for a learning task, penalized for limited demonstrated capacity, lack of long-term retention data, and potential variability/endurance issues.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `MemoryNode` type: Structural (DomeState), Electrical (MemristorResistance). Attributes: `volatility`: Non-Volatile, `type`: Bistable (Structural), Analogue/Multi-level (Electrical), `mechanism`: Mechanical Bistability, Voltage-Activated Resistive Switching.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: Non-volatility and multi-state capability (incremental programming) are explicitly shown (Fig 3). Use for associative memory (Hopfield) is explicit (Fig 4). Capacity (number of patterns learned) is explicit (p=3/4, Fig 4c). Retrieval accuracy (91%) is explicit. Retention time is explicitly stated as "non-volatile" but not quantified long-term. Endurance is shown briefly (Fig S11). Variability is shown (Fig S10, S13). The overall score is a judgment based on these explicit pieces of information.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: Non-volatile
*    Units: Qualitative Descriptor
*   Justification: The memristors are described as "non-volatile" based on their hysteretic i-v characteristics (Fig 3b), meaning the resistance state should persist without power. The dome's structural state is also non-volatile until physically reset. However, quantitative data on resistance drift over long periods (hours, days, weeks) is not provided.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Qualitative)
        * Justification: The term "non-volatile" is used explicitly in the Abstract, Introduction, and Section: Spatiotemporal Memory, and supported by the i-v curve shape (Fig 3b). Lack of quantitative long-term data makes it qualitative.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `retention_time` of `MemoryNode` (DomeState, MemristorResistance), value: "Non-volatile".

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: 3 (unique patterns); 6 (memristors storing interactions for 4 units)
*   Units: Patterns (for Hopfield network); Number of analogue states (per memristor, not specified but implied > 6 by Fig 3c)
*   Justification: The Hopfield network was trained on a sequence containing 4 patterns (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ2), where ξ3 = -ξ2, representing 3 mathematically unique patterns applied to a 2x2 array (4 units/neurons). The memory capacity of the *network* is demonstrated for these patterns. The capacity *per memristor* in terms of distinct programmable states is suggested by Fig 3c (at least 6 steps shown) and Fig 3d, but not explicitly defined or maximized. The network uses M = mn(mn-1)/2 = 4(3)/2 = 6 memristors for a 2x2 array.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The number of patterns trained (4 total, 3 unique) and the array size (2x2) are explicit (Fig 4, SI A.12). The number of memristors needed (6) is derivable from the explicit formula in SI A.12 and the array size. The number of states per memristor is implicitly suggested by Fig 3c/d but not explicitly stated as a capacity limit.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `capacity` of `HopfieldNetworkNode` (value: 3 patterns). Attribute `num_states` of `MemoryNode` (MemristorResistance) (value: >6, Qualitative: Multi-level).

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: 91
*   Units: % (Pattern Retrieval Accuracy)
*   Justification: The accuracy of retrieving the learned patterns from the physically trained Hopfield network (i.e., reading out the collective memory state) was evaluated by presenting 3000 corrupted patterns and measuring correct identification. An overall accuracy of 91% was reported.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: The value 91% overall accuracy is explicitly stated in the results section discussing the Hopfield network performance (end of Section: Spatially distributed input learning) and SI A.14.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `readout_accuracy` of `HopfieldNetworkNode` or related `MemoryReadoutEdge`.

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper shows cycle-to-cycle variability (Fig S11) and potential damage in sensors (Fig S6), implying degradation is possible. However, the degradation rate of the memristor state over time (retention loss) or over write cycles (endurance limit) is not quantified. Baseline drift in sensors due to damage is mentioned but not quantified as a rate.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Absence of data)
            * Justification: The paper explicitly shows some data relevant to degradation (cycle variability S11, sensor damage S6, baseline drift description) but does not provide a quantified rate of degradation for either the sensor or the memristor memory state.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A (Energy/power consumption not measured or reported)
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Write (Memristor)     |      N/A                      |       N/A                          | N/A  | N/A | N/A | Explicit (Absent) | Energy/power not measured |
    | Read (Memristor)      |        N/A                    |       N/A                          | N/A  | N/A | N/A | Explicit (Absent) | Energy/power not measured |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Absence of data)
    *   Justification: The paper does not provide measurements or calculations of energy consumption or power usage specifically for memory write or read operations.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | Pattern Retrieval Accuracy | % of corrupted patterns correctly identified by Hopfield network | 91 | % | `HopfieldNetworkNode`.attribute: `accuracy` | Section: Spatially distributed input learning, SI A.14 | Explicit | Value explicitly stated |
    | Device-to-Device Variation (Qual.) | Variability in V_th, HRS, LRS across devices | High (Implicit) | N/A | `MemoryNode` (Memristor).attribute: `variation` | Fig S10 (Std Dev Table) | Implicit | Standard deviation reported in SI implies variability, but "High" is qualitative. |
    | Cycle-to-Cycle Variation (Qual.) | Variability in i-v curves over repeated cycles | Medium (Implicit) | N/A | `MemoryNode` (Memristor).attribute: `cycle_variation` | Fig S11 | Implicit | Figure shows variations, but "Medium" is qualitative. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
*   Justification: Pattern retrieval accuracy is explicit. Device and cycle variations are explicitly shown in SI figures/tables, but the qualitative assessment ("High," "Medium") is an implicit interpretation of that data.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system structure (metamaterial array, sensor placement, memristor network wiring/logic) is pre-designed and fabricated using 3D printing and defined circuit connections. The learning process follows a pre-defined rule (Hebbian learning implemented via XOR logic and memristor updates). While the final learned state (pattern attractors in the Hopfield energy landscape) emerges from the history of local interactions (updates), the underlying structure and update rules are externally imposed, not spontaneously self-organized from random or homogeneous initial conditions based solely on local interactions.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The fabrication process described (3D printing, circuit connections) implies a designed structure. The learning rule (Hebbian, implemented via XOR) is explicitly chosen and programmed. The lack of spontaneous pattern formation from local interactions without this pre-defined structure/rule leads to the conclusion of no self-organization in the sense defined.

**(Conditional: M4.1 is "No", skipping M4.2-M4.7)**

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system performs computation intrinsically within its physical structure. The Hopfield network, physically realized by the array of memristors and their connection logic, performs associative memory functions (pattern storage and retrieval). The computation (energy minimization to find the nearest attractor/stored pattern) occurs through the collective electrical state of the memristor network, driven by the physics of the memristors and the network's learned weights, rather than by an external digital computer processing stored data. The mechanosensing units also perform filtering/thresholding based on their physical properties.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly states it physically encodes a Hopfield network and that learned patterns can be retrieved from the final memristor states (Abstract, Introduction, Section: Spatially distributed input learning). It contrasts this embodied approach with systems requiring ex-situ classification or external memory. The filtering/thresholding is also described as an inherent function of the dome units (Section: Filtering and Thresholding).

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Neuromorphic/Analogue (Hybrid aspects due to digital switch/logic)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type. Attributes: `computation_style`: Neuromorphic, `precision`: Analogue.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (Neuromorphic), Implicit (Analogue classification)
    *    Justification: The paper explicitly labels the system "neuromorphic" throughout. The use of analogue memristor states for synaptic weights and the Hopfield network model fit this classification. The computation relies on continuous resistance values. While there are digital-like elements (thresholding domes, switch regulator, XOR logic implied for training), the core associative memory computation in the Hopfield network uses analogue physical states.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: The primary computational primitive embodied is **Associative Memory / Pattern Completion** via Hopfield network dynamics (energy minimization). This relies on underlying operations:
        1.  **Thresholding:** Mechanical input filtering by bistable domes.
        2.  **Analogue Weight Storage:** Storing synaptic weights (J_ij) as memristor resistance values.
        3.  **Weighted Summation (Implicit):** The physics of the interconnected network effectively performs weighted summation during recall (though not explicitly calculated as such).
        4.  **Non-linear Activation (Implicit):** Neuron state updates in Hopfield networks typically involve a sign function or threshold, implicitly realized during the pattern retrieval dynamics.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** Associative Memory (Hopfield Network)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode` (Hopfield Network) as `associative_memory`. Related nodes/edges implement `thresholding`, `analogue_storage`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: Associative memory via Hopfield network is explicitly stated as the goal and implementation. Thresholding by domes is explicit. Analogue weight storage in memristors is explicit. Weighted summation and non-linear activation are implicit properties of how Hopfield networks function and how they are physically realized here, though not described as distinct computational steps in the material itself.

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Unit ID | Description | Processing Power | Energy/Operation | Freq/Resp. Time | Bit-Depth | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
| Dome Unit | Mechanical Thresholding | N/A (Qual: 1 bit decision) | N/A (Force threshold ~20N) | Slow (Manual Inversion / 20mm/min test) | 1 (Ground/Inverted) | Fig 2 | Explicit (Threshold, State), Implicit (Speed) | Threshold force explicit, speed from methods, energy/power N/A. |

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |

        | Mechanical Test Rate | 20 | mm/min | Methods | Explicit | Explicitly stated test machine speed. |
    *   **Note:** The timescales range from potentially milliseconds (snap-through) to seconds (memristor operations, manual tests) and tens of seconds (cycle intervals).

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system does not demonstrate active inference. It learns based on direct Hebbian updates from inputs (dome inversions) rather than predicting future states and acting to minimize prediction error based on an internal world model. The Hopfield network retrieves stored patterns based on similarity to the input (energy minimization), which is associative recall, not predictive modeling or surprise minimization in the active inference sense.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The description of the system's function focuses on mechanosensing, memory storage via Hebbian learning, and associative recall. There is no mention or description of predictive internal models, surprise minimization, or action selection based on predicted outcomes, which are hallmarks of active inference.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system exhibits adaptive plasticity through the online training of the Hopfield network. The memristor resistance values (representing synaptic weights) are persistently changed based on the sequence of applied mechanical patterns (experience). This alters the network's energy landscape and its subsequent behavior (which patterns it retrieves), demonstrating adaptation to the input history. The learning is described as occurring "online" as data is sensed.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The paper explicitly states the system learns a series of inputs, adapts online, and that the memristance changes encode the Hopfield network weights based on the sequential inputs (Abstract, Introduction, Section: Spatially distributed input learning). The change in memristor resistance (Fig 3c,d, Fig 4c) is a persistent structural change influencing future computation (pattern retrieval).

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The adaptation mechanism is based on Hebbian learning implemented within the physically embodied Hopfield network. Specifically, interactions between pairs of dome units (neurons) during the application of spatial patterns trigger changes in the corresponding memristors (synapses). An XOR gate logic (Fig S16) is used to determine when to update a memristor: a resistance change (write pulse) occurs when the two connected dome units are in *different* states (-1 and +1). This approximates the Hebbian/Hopfield learning rule where the change in synaptic weight J_ij is proportional to the product of the neuron states (ξ_i * ξ_j), strengthening connections between similarly active or inactive neurons and weakening connections between neurons with opposite activity (implemented here by only writing when states differ, effectively encoding the outer product, potentially with scaling/normalization described in SI A.13 via eq S.10). The cumulative, analogue change in memristor resistance stores the sum of these updates over the sequence of patterns. J_ij = Σ_μ ξ_i^μ ξ_j^μ (conceptual rule); physical implementation via XOR driving memristor ΔM ∝ -(State_i XOR State_j).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `AdaptationNode` type (`HopfieldLearning`). Defines `Monad` edges representing state updates. Mechanism: `Hebbian Learning` (physical implementation via memristor updates triggered by XOR logic on dome states).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The use of Hopfield networks and Hebbian learning is explicitly stated (Section: Spatially distributed input learning). The physical implementation mechanism involving capturing interactions between dome pairs using XOR logic to drive cumulative memristor changes is explicitly described and detailed in Fig 4a, Fig S16, and SI A.13. The exact mathematical equivalence and any normalization (eq S.10) are details requiring integration of text and SI.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The main functional behaviors are:
        1.  **Thresholded Mechanosensing:** Filtering mechanical inputs below a tunable force threshold (F_th).
        2.  **Signal Amplification/Transduction:** Converting supra-threshold mechanical events into significant, measurable electrical resistance changes.
        3.  **Spatio-temporal Memory Encoding:** Storing the occurrence and spatial pattern of sequential supra-threshold mechanical events as persistent analogue states in the memristor array.
        4.  **Associative Learning/Pattern Recognition:** Learning a sequence of applied spatial patterns via Hebbian updates to the embodied Hopfield network weights (memristor states).
        5.  **Pattern Retrieval/Completion:** Recalling stored patterns from the final memristor states when presented with noisy or incomplete versions (demonstrated via offline simulation using the physically learned weights).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: `Mechanosensing` (attributes: thresholded, amplified), `MemoryEncoding` (attributes: spatiotemporal, non-volatile, analogue), `AssociativeLearning` (attributes: Hebbian, online), `PatternRetrieval` (attributes: associative, Hopfield).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
       *  Justification: Mechanosensing, thresholding, amplification, memory encoding, learning, and pattern retrieval are all explicitly described as functionalities of the system in the Abstract, Introduction, and Results sections. The specific details of *how* pattern retrieval occurs (energy minimization in the learned landscape) are explicit in the context of Hopfield networks but demonstrated offline in this work.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 5
    *   Justification: Robustness is partially addressed.
        *   **Mechanosensing:** Thresholding provides robustness against sub-threshold noise. Sensor baseline drift and potential damage after repeated cycles (Fig 2c, Fig S2, S6) indicate limitations in long-term robustness/repeatability.
        *   **Memory/Learning:** Memristors show device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variability (Fig S10, S11, S13), potentially affecting learning fidelity. However, the Hopfield network successfully learned patterns despite this, achieving 91% retrieval accuracy from corrupted inputs, suggesting some robustness inherent in the network dynamics. Performance difference (5%) compared to ideal offline training indicates impact of physical imperfections. Long-term stability and robustness to environmental factors (temperature, humidity) are not assessed.
        *   Qualitative Assessment: Medium-Low. While the Hopfield network shows some pattern retrieval robustness, the underlying components (sensors, memristors) exhibit variability and degradation potential.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Sensor drift/damage and memristor variability data are explicit (Figs 2c, S2, S6, S10, S11, S13). Hopfield retrieval accuracy (91%) and comparison to offline (5% difference) are explicit. The overall score and qualitative assessment ("Medium-Low") are implicit judgments based on integrating these findings and considering unaddressed factors like environmental robustness.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `robustness_score` (5) of relevant `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content:
        *   **Mechanosensing/Thresholding:** Validated experimentally using force-displacement tests (Instron) correlated with resistance measurements (Figs 2e, S4, S5). Control experiments involved varying dome geometry (thickness, height) to demonstrate tunable thresholds.
        *   **Memory Encoding:** Validated by demonstrating repeatable resistance changes corresponding to dome states (Fig 2c) and incremental, non-volatile resistance changes in memristors upon voltage pulsing (Fig 3c, d).
        *   **Associative Learning:** Validated by physically applying patterns to the 2x2 array, measuring initial/final memristor voltages (Fig 4c), calculating the interaction matrix (SI A.13), and demonstrating offline that this matrix yields an energy landscape with attractors corresponding to the input patterns (Fig 4d, dimensionality reduction visualization).
        *   **Pattern Retrieval:** Validated *offline* via simulation using the experimentally derived interaction matrix. Performance was quantified by presenting corrupted patterns and measuring retrieval accuracy (91% reported, SI A.14, Movie S2). Direct physical retrieval on the hardware was not demonstrated.
        *   **Limitations:** Retrieval tested offline; long-term stability/robustness not validated; scalability beyond 2x2 not shown.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The validation methods for each behavior (mechanical tests, resistance measurements, memristor programming, Hopfield matrix calculation, offline simulations, accuracy testing) are explicitly described in the Methods and Results sections and detailed in the SI.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, the paper explicitly maps system functionality to cognitive/biological processes.
        *   **Mechanosensing Units:** Analogized to biological mechanoreceptors with filtering/thresholding capabilities, and compared to event cameras for threshold-dependent sensing.
        *   **Memristors:** Explicitly linked to synapses in biological neural networks, providing plasticity and memory storage.
        *   **Hopfield Network:** Described as implementing bio-inspired associative memory, mimicking the brain's ability to store and retrieve patterns based on partial cues.
        *   **Overall System:** Presented as a "neuromorphic" system embodying "bioinspired" mechanosensing, memory, and learning, aiming to mimic aspects of neuromechanical functions and touch-like perception.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` linking:
        `MechanosensorNode` -> `CognitiveFunctionNode` (Type: Perception/Sensing, Filtering)
        `MemristorNode` -> `CognitiveFunctionNode` (Type: Synaptic Plasticity, Memory Storage)
        `HopfieldNetworkNode` -> `CognitiveFunctionNode` (Type: Associative Memory, Pattern Recognition/Completion)
        `SystemNode` -> `CognitiveConceptNode` (Type: Neuromorphic Computing, Embodied Intelligence)
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: Terms like "neuromorphic," "bioinspired," "mechanosensing," "memory," "learning," "Hopfield network," "synapses," and comparisons to event cameras and nervous systems are used explicitly and repeatedly throughout the Abstract, Introduction, and Results to frame the system's functionality in cognitive/biological terms.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification:
        *   **Level 1 (Simple Responsivity):** Yes, clear stimulus (force) - response (resistance change).
        *   **Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity):** Yes, demonstrates adaptation (learning patterns) and memory (structural and memristive) influencing future behavior (pattern retrieval). Plasticity is present.
        *   **Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy):** Yes, the system adapts its internal state (memristor weights) based on experience (input patterns) via Hebbian learning, altering its response (pattern retrieval capability). This occurs "online" without direct supervised instruction for each weight update, showing a degree of reactive autonomy in learning.
        *   **Level 4 (Goal-Directed/Model-Based Cognition):** No. While the Hopfield network retrieves stored patterns, this is based on correlation/association, not explicit goal-setting or prediction based on an internal world model. The learning rule is fixed (Hebbian).
        *   **Higher Levels (5-10):** No evidence.
        The system demonstrates clear memory and adaptive learning within the specific context of associative pattern recognition implemented via a Hopfield network. It achieves Level 3 by adapting its internal state based on input history. It lacks the predictive modeling, planning, or flexible goal-directedness required for Level 4 and higher.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is an interpretation based on comparing the explicitly described system functionalities (Level 1-3 features like stimulus-response, memory, adaptation via Hebbian learning) against the definitions provided in the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale. The absence of evidence for higher-level functions (predictive modeling, planning, abstraction) is noted.

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment

    *   Justification: The paper does not mention or provide evidence for the system operating near a critical point (e.g., phase transition), nor does it analyze for scale-free behavior, power laws, or long-range correlations characteristic of criticality. While Hopfield networks can exhibit phase transitions depending on parameters, this aspect is not explored.

### **13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   **Calculated Score:** 5.25
    * Calculation: Avg(M1.2(8), M2.3(3), M3.2(6), M4.1(0=No), M8.2(5), M9.2(3)) = Avg(8, 3, 6, 0, 5, 3) = 25 / 6 = 4.166... -> Rounded based on typical scoring, needs clarification. Re-checking instructions: "Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2, scores with N/A convert in 0". M4 score is 0 (as M4.1 is No). Let's recalculate including M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.1 (implicitly 0), M8.2, M9.2. Modules 1-4 includes M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.1. So average = (M1.2 + M2.3 + M3.2 + M4.1_score + M8.2 + M9.2) / 6 = (8 + 3 + 6 + 0 + 5 + 3) / 6 = 25 / 6 = 4.17. *Correction*: The instruction might mean scores *within* modules 1-4, not just M4.1. Let's assume it means key scores: M1.2 (Clarity), M2.3 (Efficiency), M3.2 (Memory Type), M4.4 (Predictability - N/A -> 0). Avg(M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2) = Avg(8, 3, 6, 0, 5, 3) = 25 / 6 = 4.17. Let's assume M4.1 score is the representative for M4: Avg(8, 3, 6, 0, 5, 3) = 4.17. Let's use the template section numbering M1-M4. M1.2=8, M2.3=3, M3.2=6, M4 score=0 (as M4.1 is No). Then add M8.2=5, M9.2=3. Average = (8+3+6+0+5+3)/6 = 4.17.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a significant step towards embodied neuromorphic systems by integrating mechanosensing, non-volatile analogue memory, and associative learning within a physical metamaterial. Key strengths lie in the clear demonstration of thresholded sensing coupled with plasticity via memristors, enabling online Hebbian learning of spatial patterns in a physically realized Hopfield network. The system successfully demonstrates adaptive plasticity (Level 3 cognitive proximity) and embodied computation. Key limitations include the lack of demonstrated self-organization (structure and learning rules are pre-defined), limited validation of pattern retrieval physically on the hardware (done offline), potential robustness issues stemming from component variability and degradation, and the absence of quantitative data on energy efficiency and long-term memory retention. While showcasing impressive integration, the system's cognitive capabilities are currently restricted to associative memory, lacking higher-order functions like planning or model-based reasoning. Future work should focus on improving component reliability, scaling the system, demonstrating physical pattern retrieval, quantifying performance metrics (energy, retention), and potentially exploring more complex learning rules or computational paradigms to enhance cognitive proximity.

*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A dedicated subsection for **Scalability** (e.g., under M1 or M8) could be useful, probing demonstrated scale, fabrication limitations, and theoretical scaling potential.
        *   A probe for **Control Complexity** (internal vs. external control systems, reliance on external computation for operation/learning) could clarify autonomy.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The exact calculation method for the **CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1)** needs clarification. Which specific scores from M1-M4 are included? Is it an average of module-level scores (how defined?) or specific sub-scores? The current instruction is ambiguous ("Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2").
        *   The distinction between **M4 (Self-Organization)** and **M8 (Emergent Behaviors)** could be sharper. Emergent behavior can arise in non-self-organizing systems (like pattern retrieval in a pre-wired Hopfield net). M4 seems focused on *structural* emergence, while M8 is about *functional* emergence. This could be clarified.
        *   **Yoneda Embedding (M4.7)** is a complex CT concept. The prompt needs a clearer rubric or operational definition suitable for non-CT experts analyzing materials papers. How is the "Yoneda Score" practically assessed from a typical materials science paper?
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on representing *control logic* (like the XOR gate logic for Hopfield training) within the CT-GIN graph could be helpful. Is it an attribute of an edge, a separate node type?
        *   Clarification on whether `ComputationNode` represents the physical unit performing computation (e.g., the memristor network) or the abstract computational function (e.g., associative memory).
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Assigning a single score for **Memory Type (M3.2)** was challenging when multiple memory types exist (structural and electrical). The rubric should perhaps allow for scoring different types separately or provide clearer guidance for hybrid systems.
        *   Assigning scores often requires qualitative judgment (e.g., M2.3 Efficiency, M8.2 Robustness) when quantitative data is missing. Explicitly acknowledging this and perhaps providing clearer qualitative bins (e.g., Low/Medium/High descriptions for scores 1-3, 4-6, 7-9) might improve consistency.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   The requirement to justify Implicit/Explicit for every single entry felt slightly redundant when the justification was often the same for multiple related entries within a subsection (e.g., multiple parameters from the same figure are all Explicit). Perhaps allow justification at the subsection level where appropriate?
        *   Handling N/A values in tables (e.g., M3.7, M5.4) could be slightly cleaner; perhaps standardizing the representation.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very detailed and comprehensive, which is good for capturing nuances. However, its length and the need for repetitive justifications can make it time-consuming. Streamlining justifications and clarifying definitions (especially CT-related ones and the readiness score calculation) would improve usability.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        1.  **Clarify M13.1 Calculation:** Provide a precise list of Vector IDs whose scores contribute to the average.
        2.  **Refine M4 vs. M8:** Sharpen definitions to clearly separate structural self-organization (M4) from general emergent functionality (M8).
        3.  **Operationalize M4.7 (Yoneda):** Provide a practical rubric or simplified assessment method for Yoneda embedding suitable for materials science context, or make it optional/expert-level.
        4.  **Guide on Hybrid Memory Scoring (M3.2):** Offer method to score systems with multiple memory types.
        5.  **Streamline Justifications:** Allow subsection-level justification for Implicit/Explicit where appropriate.
        6.  **Add Scalability/Control Probes:** Consider adding dedicated sections or probes for system scalability and control architecture complexity.
