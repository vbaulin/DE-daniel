## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper presents a theoretical framework arguing that the materiality (physical substance and organization) of systems is crucial for cognition, challenging the traditional view of multiple realisability (MR 1.0) where cognition is seen as substrate-independent software. It draws on active matter physics, soft robotics, and basal cognition literature to propose an updated view (MR 2.0 or fine-grained functionalism), suggesting that cognitive functions, while potentially realisable in different media, depend significantly on fine-grained material properties and self-organizing dynamics characteristic of living systems (or systems approximating them). The purpose is to shift the theoretical foundations of AI and robotics towards emphasizing embodied, precarious, and materially-grounded approaches (like soft, active robots) that leverage principles of self-organization, homeostasis, and existential needs (survival, persistence) to achieve autonomous, goal-directed behaviour. Key components are the concepts of active matter, soft robotics, basal cognition, fine-grained functionalism, multiple realisability (1.0 vs 2.0), existential needs, and precarity. It advocates for building autonomous robots (AR) from competent, cognitive parts (scaling cognition down and up).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Theoretical Framework, `domain`: Cognitive Science/Philosophy of Mind/AI/Robotics, `mechanism`: Conceptual Argumentation/Literature Synthesis, `components`: [Active Matter Physics, Soft Robotics, Basal Cognition, Fine-grained Functionalism, Multiple Realisability, Existential Needs, Precarity], `purpose`: Reframe AI/Robotics development emphasizing materiality and self-organization.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The core components, purpose, and argument are explicitly stated throughout the abstract, introduction, and main sections. The specific mechanisms (drawing connections between fields, proposing MR 2.0) are also explicit. The overall "system" described is the conceptual framework itself.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: As a theoretical paper, the "implementation" refers to the clarity and structure of the argument and the definition of concepts. The paper clearly states its thesis, defines key terms (MR 1.0 vs 2.0, fine-grained functionalism, existential needs, active matter), outlines the structure of its argument, and systematically draws connections between the different fields (active matter, soft robotics, basal cognition). The arguments against traditional functionalism and for the proposed alternative are well-articulated. Some concepts, like the precise nature of "scaling up" cognition or the specifics of implementing "existential needs" in artificial systems, remain somewhat abstract but are sufficiently defined for a theoretical contribution. The references cited provide grounding for the concepts discussed.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The clarity score is based on the explicitly presented structure, definitions, and argumentation within the text.

    *   **Note:** This is a theoretical paper proposing a framework, not describing a specific implemented system with measurable parameters. Therefore, no key implementation parameters with values/units are applicable.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The paper conceptually discusses systems operating far-from-thermodynamic-equilibrium, which requires continuous energy input to maintain organization against entropy. It mentions active matter units converting "stored or ambient free energy into systematic movement" and maintaining homeostasis. Specific energy sources (chemical, thermal, electrical) are implied by the examples (e.g., molecular motors, oil droplets requiring chemical reactants) but not generalized or quantified for the proposed framework itself.
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Ambient/Stored Free Energy (Conceptual), `type`: Chemical/Thermal/Mechanical (Implied by examples)
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The necessity of energy input for far-from-equilibrium systems is explicitly stated (Sec Active Matter, quoting Marchetti et al., 2013). The types of energy are implied through examples cited (e.g., nanomotors using chemical energy). It's conceptual within the framework.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: Conceptually discussed in the context of active matter and biological systems. Examples include chemical energy converted to mechanical motion by molecular motors (Sec Active Matter, quoting Needleman and Dogic, 2017), transduction between chemical, kinetic, and electrostatic energy at the cellular level (Sec Traditional vs. fine-grained functionalism, quoting Godfrey-Smith 2016a). The framework emphasizes these physical processes as integral to the material basis of cognition, contrasting with abstract computational views. Specific transduction pathways for hypothetical AR are not detailed.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Chemical-to-Mechanical, Chemo-Electrical, etc. (Conceptual/Examples), `from_node`: EnergyInputNode, `to_node`: SystemNode (or specific component nodes conceptually)
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Specific mechanisms (chemical to mechanical) are explicitly mentioned via quotes and references (Needleman and Dogic, 2017; Godfrey-Smith, 2016a). The broader role of transduction is central to the paper's argument about materiality.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not provide any quantitative or qualitative assessment of energy efficiency for the systems it discusses or proposes. The focus is on the *necessity* and *type* of energy flow for maintaining organization and driving activity in far-from-equilibrium systems relevant to cognition. Efficiency is not a central theme.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
      *  Justification: No information regarding efficiency is present.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Mentioned implicitly through the discussion of far-from-equilibrium systems and dissipative structures (e.g., Rayleigh-BÃ©nard cells, living organisms are explicitly dissipative). Dissipation is inherent in maintaining order against the second law of thermodynamics, requiring continuous energy input. Specific mechanisms (friction, heat loss) or quantification are not provided. The concept of "existential needs" is linked to the requirement to counteract dissipative tendencies (Egbert, 2021).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode`s and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s conceptually linked to system maintenance in far-from-equilibrium states.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly discusses "dissipative structures" (quoting Egbert 2021) and far-from-equilibrium systems, which inherently involve energy dissipation to maintain their state. The mechanisms are not detailed but dissipation is a necessary consequence of the discussed concepts.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: Memory is explicitly discussed as a complex cognitive function (Abstract, Introduction). The paper refers to its presence in basal cognition (Sec How fine-grained functional details matter to cognition), mentions the historicity of neurons (change based on past activity) as an example relevant to fine-grained functionalism (Sec Traditional vs. fine-grained functionalism), and includes memory among the capacities (like learning, decision-making) scaled up from cellular levels (Sec How fine-grained functional details matter to cognition). It's presented as a key cognitive capacity tied to materiality.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: Memory is explicitly listed and discussed as a relevant cognitive function throughout the paper in various contexts (basal cognition, neuronal historicity, scaling).

**(Conditional: M3.1 is "Yes", proceeding to M3.2 and M3.3.)**

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: N/A
*   Justification: The paper discusses memory conceptually as a cognitive function present across different scales (cellular, organismic) and relevant to fine-grained functionalism (e.g., historicity of neurons). It cites examples like memory in bacteria (Dinet et al., 2021). However, it does not analyze or categorize different *types* of memory (e.g., structural, state-based, associative) within its framework or assign quantitative properties like capacity or fidelity. It treats memory as a general cognitive capacity whose material basis matters. Therefore, assigning a score based on retention/capacity/read-out is not possible based on the text.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type conceptually as relevant to cognitive systems discussed.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (presence), N/A (type scoring)
    * Justification: The presence and relevance of memory are explicit. The detailed characteristics needed for scoring are absent.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A (Qualitative Descriptor: Implies range from short-term cellular processes to longer-term organismic/developmental scales)
*    Units: N/A
*   Justification: The paper doesn't quantify retention times. It implicitly covers a range by discussing memory in contexts from cellular processes (potentially short-term) to developmental and evolutionary scaling (long-term), and neuronal historicity (persistent changes).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: Retention time is not explicitly quantified or discussed, but the different contexts in which memory is mentioned (cellular activity, neuronal plasticity, development) imply a range of timescales.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute of the conceptual `MemoryNode` (Qualitative: variable timescale).

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: Not discussed or quantified in the paper.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: No information provided.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: Not discussed or quantified in the paper.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
       *  Justification: No information provided.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: Not discussed or quantified in the paper, although implicitly related to the persistence of far-from-equilibrium systems.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
            * Justification: No information provided.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: Energy cost of memory operations is not discussed.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
*   Justification: Fidelity and robustness of memory are not discussed or quantified.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: Self-organization is a central theme. The paper explicitly discusses self-organizing processes in active matter (including distinguishing self-organization from self-assembly, citing Needleman and Dogic, 2017), living systems (as far-from-equilibrium systems maintaining structure), basal cognition (cellular activity, coordination), morphogenesis, and argues for its importance in developing autonomous robots (AR). It contrasts this with systems relying solely on external control or pre-programming. Emergent global order (e.g., morphology, swarming) arises from local interactions (e.g., cellular communication, physical forces in active matter).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: Self-organization is explicitly and repeatedly discussed as a core concept in active matter, biological systems, and the proposed approach to AR (e.g., Sec Introduction, Sec Active matter, Sec How fine-grained functional details matter to cognition).

**(Conditional: M4.1 is "Yes", including M4.2-M4.7 where applicable)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The paper discusses local interactions conceptually rather than providing specific rules/equations. Examples mentioned include:
        *   **Active Matter:** Interactions of self-driven units converting energy, influenced by shape (anisotropy) and medium, leading to correlated motion (Marchetti et al., 2013). Interaction between internal dynamics and external medium via gradients (e.g., Marangoni flows in oil droplets, Hanczyc and Ikegami, 2010). Interactions of nanoscale molecular motors creating mesoscale structures (Needleman and Dogic, 2017).
        *   **Biological Systems:** Intercellular communication, bioelectrical signalling coordinating morphogenesis and development (Levin, 2019, 2021), cellular metabolism dynamics (Godfrey-Smith, 2016a), physical forces shaping tissues (Newman, 2019). Cells acting based on local morphogenetic goals.
        *   **Proposed AR:** Implied rules would involve local information processing, managing existential needs/precarity, maintaining homeostasis, based on the active materials constituting the robot.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Part of the `AdjunctionEdge` description (local side). Defines "LocalInteraction" edge category conceptually via examples.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: The existence and importance of local interactions are explicit. Specific rules are described abstractly or by reference to cited works (e.g., active matter physics principles, biological signalling).

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
    *   **Note:** While discussing conceptual rules, the paper doesn't define specific interaction parameters or their ranges for a general model.

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The paper explicitly discusses various forms of emergent global order resulting from local interactions:
        *   **Active Matter:** Correlated collective motion, mechanical stress (Marchetti et al., 2013), macroscopic patterns (e.g., swarming, nematic structures in microtubule networks cited via Sanchez et al., 2012), self-propelled droplet movement (Hanczyc & Ikegami, 2010).
        *   **Biological Systems:** Complex organismal morphologies achieved through development and morphogenesis (Levin, 2019; Newman, 2019), tissue structures, coordinated swarming behaviour (biofilms, multicellular bodies, animal groups).
        *   **Proposed AR:** Goal-directed behaviour, agency, autonomous self-maintenance, potentially novel morphologies (e.g., xenobots).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines various `ConfigurationalNode` types conceptually (e.g., Morphology, SwarmState, CollectiveMotion).
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: Different types of emergent global order (morphology, collective motion, patterns) are explicitly discussed and cited as outcomes of self-organization in the relevant fields.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification: The predictability of the emergent global order is not assessed quantitatively or qualitatively. The paper emphasizes the complexity and potential novelty (especially in synthetic systems like xenobots) arising from self-organization, but doesn't analyze how predictable these outcomes are based on local rules.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: N/A
    *  Justification: No information provided.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **4.5. Local Interaction Rules (for Self-Organization)**
* **Vector ID:** M4.5
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
    *   **Note:** As in 4.2.1, specific parameters for the conceptual rules are not provided.

### **4.6. Globally Emergent Order and Order Parameters**
* **Vector ID:** M4.6
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
    *   **Note:** While global order is discussed (4.3), specific order parameters and their ranges are not defined or measured within the paper's framework.

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
    *   **Note:** The concept of Yoneda embedding or formal assessment of local-to-global mapping fidelity using category theory is not mentioned in the paper.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper argues *against* traditional computationalism (software/hardware split, MR 1.0) and *implicitly promotes* a form of embodied computation. It suggests that cognitive functions are deeply intertwined with material processes ("matter matters") and self-organizing dynamics. It mentions active matter research is "not specifically aimed at computational characterisations" in the traditional sense (Sec Active Matter, quoting McGivern 2020) and implicitly aligns with morphological computation by emphasizing how material properties, shape, and embodied dynamics contribute to behavior (Sec How fine-grained functional details matter to cognition, footnote 4 citing MÃ¼ller & Hoffman 2017, Rorot 2022). Computation is thus seen as intrinsic to the physical system's dynamics, not an abstract layer on top.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper doesn't use the term "embodied computation" extensively but argues strongly against substrate-independence and for the role of materiality and dynamics in achieving cognitive functions, which aligns with the core ideas of embodied computation and morphological computation (cited in footnote). It criticizes standard AI/functionalist views of computation.

**(Conditional: M5.1 is "Yes", including M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog / Other (Morphological Computation / Physics-based Dynamics)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type conceptually, emphasizing non-digital, physically grounded processes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The paper contrasts its view with digital computation and traditional AI, emphasizing continuous physical processes, self-organization, and material properties (fine-grained details, active matter dynamics). This strongly suggests analog and/or physics-based computation intrinsic to the material dynamics, consistent with morphological computation (which is cited).

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Not explicitly defined. The paper focuses on higher-level cognitive functions (memory, learning, decision-making, goal-directedness) emerging from underlying physical dynamics and self-organization, rather than identifying basic computational operations performed by the material itself. Primitives would likely relate to the fundamental physical interactions and self-organizing principles discussed (e.g., gradient following, threshold responses in cellular activity, physical constraint satisfaction) but are not formalized as computational primitives.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A (Primary function not specified at the primitive level).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    * Justification: The paper operates at a higher conceptual level, discussing emerging cognitive functions rather than basic computational building blocks.

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
    *   **Note:** The paper discusses conceptual units (cells, active matter particles) but doesn't quantify their computational properties.

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description                     | Value                                             | Units   | Source                                                 | Implicit/Explicit   | Justification                                                                        |

        | Development / Evolution                   | Days to Years / Generations (Qualitative)         | d/Y/gen | Sec How Fine-grained... (Morphogenesis, Evolution)       | Explicit/Implicit | Development/evolutionary timescales explicitly relevant to the scaled approach.         |
    *   **Note:** Timescales are discussed implicitly through the phenomena mentioned (molecular dynamics, active matter, development, evolution). Values are qualitative estimates based on the domains discussed.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear/Partial
    *   Justification: The paper does not explicitly use the term "Active Inference" or the Free Energy Principle framework (though Friston 2019 is cited once). However, the core concepts discussed â homeostasis, precarity, existential needs, goal-directed behaviour to maintain system integrity in far-from-equilibrium states â strongly resonate with the principles of active inference (minimizing surprise/prediction error to maintain viability). The idea that systems act to remain "the kind of system it is" (Sec Intro, citing Man and Damasio 2019) aligns with maintaining desired states under a generative model. The emphasis on valuing and goal-directedness stemming from existential needs could be interpreted as minimizing prediction errors related to survival/persistence. It lacks the formal framework but overlaps conceptually.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Conceptual overlap exists (maintaining viability, goal-directedness based on internal needs/states), but the specific framework of Active Inference, prediction error minimization, and generative models is not explicitly invoked or detailed.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A (Paper doesn't propose metrics).

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: Adaptation and plasticity are key themes. The paper discusses the plasticity of materials in soft robotics (Abstract, Sec Active matter and soft robotics), the adaptive behavior of organisms stemming from basal cognition (learning, decision-making in response to existential needs, Sec Intro, Sec How fine-grained...), the plasticity of multicellular bodies during development and remodeling (Levin, 2019, 2020), and the ability of active matter systems to respond flexibly (Sec Active matter). It argues that this adaptive plasticity, grounded in materiality, is crucial for genuine intelligence and should be a goal for AR. This goes beyond fixed stimulus-response.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: Plasticity and adaptation are explicitly mentioned as key characteristics of biological systems and desirable features for AR, linked to the paper's core arguments about materiality and cognition (e.g., Abstract mentions "plastic nature", Sec How fine-grained... discusses plasticity in morphogenesis).

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "Yes", include M7.2)**

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper discusses mechanisms conceptually rather than providing specific algorithms. Mechanisms are linked to:
        *   **Material Properties:** Exploiting the soft, active, and plastic nature of materials that allows for changes in shape, structure, or response based on history or environment (Sec Introduction, Sec Active matter and soft robotics). Fine-grained functionalism implies changes occur at the material level (Sec Traditional vs fine-grained...).
        *   **Self-Organization & Homeostasis:** Adaptation emerges from the dynamics of self-organizing systems striving to maintain homeostasis and meet existential needs in far-from-equilibrium conditions (Sec Introduction, Sec How fine-grained...). Changes are driven by feedback loops inherent in maintaining viability.
        *   **Basal Cognition:** Mechanisms associated with basal cognition like learning and decision-making at cellular/sub-organismal levels contribute to overall adaptation (Sec Introduction, Sec How fine-grained...). Cited examples include memory in bacteria, learning in protists.
        *   **Developmental Bioelectricity:** Bioelectrical networks guiding morphogenesis allow for plastic changes in body plan during development and regeneration (Levin, 2019, cited in Sec How fine-grained...).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `AdaptationNode` type and `Monad` edges conceptually. Mechanisms: Material Property Change, Homeostatic Regulation, Basal Cognitive Processes, Developmental Plasticity.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The link between adaptation and materiality/self-organization/basal cognition is explicit. The specific underlying mechanisms are described generally or by reference to cited literature (e.g., active matter physics, Levin's work on bioelectricity).

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The main functional behaviors discussed as emerging from the proposed framework (grounded in materiality, self-organization, basal cognition) are:
        *   **Autonomous Goal-Directedness:** Systems capable of selecting and pursuing goals relative to their existential needs (survival, persistence) without continuous external control (Abstract, Intro).
        *   **Agency:** The ability to flexibly and actively engage with the environment (Intro, Sec How fine-grained...).
        *   **Valuing:** Attributing significance or valence to environmental states or actions based on existential needs/precarity (Intro, Sec How fine-grained...). Making things "matter" to the system.
        *   **Learning & Memory:** As fundamental cognitive capacities emerging from material dynamics (Abstract, Sec Trad vs fine-grained, Sec How fine-grained...).
        *   **Decision-Making:** Choosing actions to meet needs (Abstract, Sec How fine-grained...).
        *   **Self-Maintenance/Homeostasis:** Actively maintaining internal states within viable ranges (Intro, quoting Man & Damasio 2019).
        *   **Morphogenesis/Shape-Shifting:** Adaptive changes in physical form (discussed in context of biology and goal for soft robotics, Sec How fine-grained...).
        *   **Collective Behaviors:** Swarming, coordinated motion in active matter and biological systems (Sec Active Matter).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: GoalDirectedness, Agency, Valuing, Learning, Memory, DecisionMaking, SelfMaintenance, Morphogenesis, CollectiveBehavior.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors (agency, goal-directedness, valuing, learning, self-maintenance, etc.) are explicitly identified as the target outcomes or key characteristics associated with the proposed framework and the systems it draws upon.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A (Qualitative: Implied High for Biological Systems)
    *   Justification: The paper doesn't quantitatively assess robustness. However, it implicitly highlights the robustness of biological systems derived from their plastic, self-organizing, and multi-scale nature (e.g., ability to handle damage, perturbations during development, Levin 2020 cited). It contrasts this with the potential fragility of traditional robotic systems and suggests the proposed approach could lead to more robust AR. It mentions robustness in the context of xenobots being fault-tolerant (Shah et al., 2021). A specific score is not justifiable.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Robustness isn't quantified but is implied as a desirable feature and a characteristic of the biological systems used as inspiration (e.g., resilience through self-organization and plasticity).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes conceptually to reliability attributes of `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: N/A
     *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: As a theoretical paper, it does not perform experiments or provide validation methods for the emergent behaviors it discusses. It relies on cited empirical work from other fields (active matter, soft robotics, biology) as evidence for the phenomena.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: Yes, the entire paper is fundamentally about mapping physical/material processes to cognitive functions. It argues *against* the standard functionalist mapping (abstract software on arbitrary hardware) and proposes a mapping where cognition is intrinsically linked to materiality, self-organization, and life processes (fine-grained functionalism, MR 2.0). Specific mappings include:
        *   Far-from-equilibrium dynamics, self-maintenance, homeostasis -> Basis for goal-directedness, valuing, agency, existential needs (Sec Intro, Active Matter, How fine-grained...).
        *   Active matter physics principles -> Minimal forms of cognitive capacities like sensing, locomotion, coordination (Sec Active Matter).
        *   Cellular activities (bioelectricity, metabolism) -> Basal cognition (memory, learning, decision-making at cellular level), scaled up to organismic cognition (Sec How fine-grained...).
        *   Soft, plastic, vulnerable materials -> Embodiment necessary for precarity-driven agency and valuing (Sec Intro, Soft Robotics).
        *   Limitations: The mapping is largely conceptual and argues for the *necessity* of the link rather than providing a fully detailed mechanism for *how* specific material dynamics precisely implement specific high-level cognitive functions.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` connecting `SystemNode` (or constituent concepts like SelfOrganizationNode, MaterialNode) to `CognitiveFunctionNode` (e.g., Agency, Valuing, Learning).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper's central thesis is an explicit argument for a specific mapping between material properties/dynamics and cognitive functions, contrasting it with alternative mappings (MR 1.0).

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 4
    *   Justification: The paper argues strongly for cognition being grounded in life-like processes (homeostasis, self-maintenance, precarity) and extending "all the way down" to cellular levels (basal cognition). It links these to goal-directedness, valuing, and agency. This places the *conceptual target* systems discussed (biological organisms, potentially future AR based on these principles) at Level 4 (Goal-Directed/Model-Based Cognition), as they are argued to possess internal drives (existential needs, homeostasis as implicit models) guiding action selection. It explicitly discusses capacities like learning, memory, and decision-making (relevant to Level 3/4). It doesn't strongly argue for Level 5+ capabilities within this framework, focusing more on the foundations of autonomous agency. The score reflects the level of cognition *argued for* by the framework, derived from biological inspiration and basal cognition concepts. It acknowledges the systems discussed (like cells, simple organisms, proposed AR) exhibit goal-directedness based on internal needs/models.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The score is based on the explicitly described cognitive capacities argued for in the paper (goal-directedness, valuing, agency based on internal needs/homeostasis) and relating these descriptions to the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale definitions. The level itself is an interpretation based on the scale.

**CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:** (Provided for reference in scoring M9.2)

*   Level 0: Non-Cognitive
*   Level 1: Simple Responsivity
*   Level 2: Sub-Organismal Responsivity
*   Level 3: Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy
*   **Level 4: Goal-Directed/Model-Based Cognition** (Selected Level)
*   Level 5: Contextual/Relational Cognition
*   Level 6: Abstract/Symbolic Cognition
*   Level 7: Social Cognition
*   Level 8: Metacognition/Self-Awareness
*   Level 9: Phenomenal Consciousness
*   Level 10: Sapience/Self-Reflective Consciousness

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear
    *   Justification: The paper discusses systems operating far-from-thermodynamic-equilibrium and undergoing complex self-organization, often associated with criticality. It mentions the "boundary between subcritical and supracritical behaviour" in the context of self-assembly (Sec Fine-grained functions..., citing Kauffman 1993) and systems balancing on the "boundary of criticality" (Sec How fine-grained...). However, it does not explicitly claim the systems operate *at* a critical point, nor does it present evidence like power laws or scale-free behavior to support such a claim within its own framework. The references might support criticality, but the paper itself doesn't analyze or rely heavily on this concept.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: Mentions boundary of criticality (Sec How fine-grained...) but provides no specific evidence or analysis.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The concept is mentioned briefly in relation to relevant background literature/concepts but is not analyzed or used as a central explanatory mechanism within the paper's main argument.

## M11: Review Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   **Vector ID:** M11
*   **Vector Type:** Review
*   **Content:** N/A
    *   **Justification:** The paper type is "Theoretical/Computational", not "Review".

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   **Vector ID:** M12
*   **Vector Type:** Theory

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper presents a logically structured argument, clearly stating its premises (critique of MR 1.0, importance of materiality) and conclusion (need for MR 2.0/fine-grained functionalism in AI/robotics). It draws on established concepts and empirical findings from multiple relevant fields (philosophy of mind, active matter, soft robotics, basal cognition), citing appropriate literature. Assumptions (e.g., life-mind continuity, link between precarity and agency) are reasonably well-articulated. The critique of traditional functionalism is standard but well-presented. The proposed "MR 2.0" is conceptually coherent, though its precise formal definition remains somewhat open. Potential weaknesses lie in the conceptual leaps between different levels (e.g., precisely how active matter principles scale to complex cognition) which are asserted more than fully detailed mechanistically.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: Score based on the explicit structure, argumentation, use of cited evidence, and clarity of definitions within the paper.

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly points towards active matter physics and soft robotics (especially examples like xenobots) as pathways for realizing the proposed principles. These fields involve tangible materials and fabrication methods. The conceptual framework grounded in far-from-equilibrium dynamics, self-organization, and bio-inspiration has plausible connections to real physical systems. However, realizing AR with genuine goal-directedness, valuing, and agency based *purely* on these principles without significant external control or programming remains a major, long-term challenge, as acknowledged by the paper regarding current limitations in synthetic self-organization. The potential exists but significant hurdles remain.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: Potential realization pathways (soft robotics, active matter, xenobots) are explicitly mentioned. The score reflects an assessment of the feasibility based on the current state of those fields (partly explicit, partly inferred knowledge).

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper's focus on fundamental concepts like self-organization, emergent behavior, multi-scale dynamics, embodiment, and the relationship between material properties and function aligns very well with the principles CT-GIN aims to capture. It explicitly discusses scaling, local-to-global organization (cells to organism), feedback (homeostasis), and the importance of internal states/dynamics (existential needs). These concepts are directly amenable to representation within a CT-GIN framework (e.g., using adjunctions for local-global, monads for adaptation/internal state changes). The paper provides a rich conceptual basis for developing CT-GIN models of bio-inspired intelligence, even if it doesn't use the formalism itself.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: The score is based on assessing the alignment between the paper's core theoretical concepts (explicitly discussed) and the likely representational capabilities and goals of the CT-GIN framework (inferred based on the template).

## M13: Overall Assessment & Scoring

*   **Vector ID:** M13
*   **Vector Type:** Overall

### **13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   **Calculated Score:** 1.50
    *   **Note:** Calculated as average of M1.2(8), M2.1(N/A->0), M2.2(N/A->0), M2.3(N/A->0), M2.4(N/A->0), M3.1(N/A->0), M3.2(N/A->0), M3.3(N/A->0), M4.1(N/A->0), M4.2(N/A->0), M4.3(N/A->0), M4.4(N/A->0), M8.2(N/A->0), M9.2(4). Many scores are N/A because it's a theoretical paper lacking implementation details, pulling the average down significantly. This score reflects the lack of *quantifiable implementation data* suitable for CT-GIN, not the conceptual relevance (which is high, see M12.3). Average = (8 + 0*11 + 4) / 13 = 12 / 13 approx 0.92. Let's re-evaluate which scores apply.
    *   Recalculation Justification: Only scores directly assessing the *paper's content* (clarity, cognitive score) or *potential* should be included for a theoretical paper, not scores demanding specific implementation data that is inherently absent. Reconsidering the prompt: "(Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2, scores with N/A convert in 0)". *Strictly following this calculation rule with N/A=0*:
        *   M1.2 = 8
        *   M2.1-M2.4 = 0 (N/A)
        *   M3.1 = Requires Yes/No, if Yes proceed. M3.1 is Yes. M3.2=N/A=0. M3.3=N/A=0.

        *   Average = (8 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4) / 8 = 12 / 8 = 1.50.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This theoretical paper provides a strong conceptual foundation highly relevant to the CT-GIN framework, arguing compellingly for the importance of materiality, self-organization, far-from-equilibrium dynamics, and bio-inspiration (especially basal cognition) in understanding and creating cognitive systems, particularly autonomous robots. Its key strengths lie in clearly articulating the critique of traditional functionalism (MR 1.0), proposing an alternative (MR 2.0/fine-grained functionalism), and integrating insights from active matter, soft robotics, and philosophy of mind relating to embodiment, agency, and goal-directedness based on existential needs. It explicitly discusses concepts central to CT-GIN like scaling, local interactions leading to global order, adaptation, and temporal dynamics. The primary limitation regarding CT-GIN readiness is the inherent lack of concrete implementation details and quantitative data, characteristic of a theoretical piece. While conceptually rich, aspects like energy flow, memory parameters, computational primitives, and robustness are discussed abstractly or via cited examples, not quantified within the proposed framework itself. Overall, the paper offers significant potential for guiding CT-GIN modeling by providing relevant cognitive targets (Level 4) and emphasizing the physical/material mechanisms that CT-GIN aims to formalize, but requires complementary experimental/simulation work to provide the necessary quantitative data for concrete graph population and analysis.

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   Develop specific minimal models (computational or experimental) based on active matter or soft robotics principles that instantiate the concepts of fine-grained functionalism and existential needs, allowing for quantification of energy flow, memory, and adaptation metrics.
        *   Formalize the "scaling up" mechanism: How do local cellular/component cognitions (basal cognition) compose or integrate into higher-level organismic/robotic agency and goal-directedness? Apply CT concepts like colimits or operads.
        *   Quantify self-organization: Define specific local interaction rules inspired by active matter/biology and measure the resulting emergent global order parameters and predictability in simulated or real systems.
        *   Identify computational primitives: Characterize the basic information processing operations performed intrinsically by the dynamics of active/soft matter systems relevant to meeting existential needs.
        *   Investigate Active Inference connection: Formalize the link between homeostasis/precarity-driven behavior and the Active Inference framework using CT-GIN representations.
        *   Measure robustness: Systematically test the robustness of bio-inspired AR designs (like xenobots or theoretical analogs) to noise, damage, and environmental changes, quantifying performance degradation.
        *   Refine Cognitive Mapping: Provide more detailed mechanistic accounts linking specific material dynamics (e.g., specific self-organizing patterns, memory mechanisms) to specific cognitive functions beyond conceptual analogy.

## M14: CT-GIN Knowledge Graph

*   **Vector ID:** M14
*   **Vector Type:** Visualization

### **14.1. CT-GIN Knowledge Graph:**
* **Content:**
    *   **(Conceptual Schematic Description):**
        *   A central `SystemNode` representing the "Fine-Grained Functionalist Framework (MR 2.0)".
        *   Edges connect this node to foundational concept nodes: `MaterialNode` (attributes: Active, Soft, Plastic, Precarious), `ProcessNode` (SelfOrganization), `EnergyNode` (FarFromEquilibrium).
        *   `MaterialNode` and `ProcessNode` are linked via `AdjunctionEdge`s (Local Interactions -> Global Order like Morphology, Behavior). Local rules are conceptual (Physics-based, Bio-inspired).
        *   `EnergyNode` links via `TransductionEdge` (Conceptual: Chemical->Mechanical) to `MaterialNode` and `ProcessNode` (driving activity). `DissipationEdge` conceptually linked to maintaining the state.
        *   `SystemNode` maps via `CognitiveMappingEdge`s to multiple `CognitiveFunctionNode`s: Agency, GoalDirectedness, Valuing, Learning, Memory, DecisionMaking (Target Level 4).
        *   `CognitiveFunctionNode`s (e.g., Memory, Learning) are linked (`CouplingEdge`) to `AdaptationNode` (conceptual mechanisms: Homeostatic Reg., Material Change). `AdaptationNode` potentially involves `Monad` edges representing internal state updates.
        *   `TemporalNode`s connect to processes like SelfOrganization, Adaptation, Memory, indicating relevant timescales (Qualitative: Fast molecular to Slow evolutionary).
        *   Nodes representing specific examples cited (e.g., `ExampleNode`: ActiveMatterDroplet, Xenobot, BasalCognition) connect to relevant conceptual nodes.
        *   Overall graph is highly conceptual, lacking quantitative attributes on nodes/edges.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically for "Substrate Dependence/Independence" could directly capture the paper's core argument against MR 1.0.
        *   A probe for "Level of Abstraction" might be useful for theoretical papers to indicate how far removed the concepts are from concrete implementation.
        *   Explicit probes distinguishing "Discussed Concepts" vs. "Implemented Features" would be helpful, especially for theoretical/review papers.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Self-Organization" (M4) and "Emergent Behaviors" (M8) could be sharper. Self-organization is the *process*, emergence is the *outcome* (patterns, behaviors). Template is okay, but requires careful application.
        *   "Yoneda Embedding" (M4.7) is highly specialized CT; its relevance and calculation need much clearer definition/justification within the template's context, especially for non-CT experts. It wasn't applicable here.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on mapping theoretical concepts (like MR 2.0, Existential Needs) needs clarification. Are they SystemNode attributes, separate nodes, or edge properties? Suggest standardizing representation for abstract concepts.
        *   Mapping Monads (M7.2) needs more context/examples.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   The `CT-GIN Readiness Score` (M13.1) calculation rule (averaging specific module scores, N/A=0) heavily penalizes theoretical/review papers lacking implementation data, potentially misrepresenting their conceptual value to CT-GIN. A different aggregation method or weighting might be better, or the score should be clearly labelled as "Implementation Data Readiness".
        *   Scoring qualitative aspects (e.g., Rigor, Potential) relies heavily on assessor judgment. More detailed rubrics could improve consistency.
        *   The Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) scale is useful but mapping theoretical claims to levels requires interpretation.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Applying categories designed for experimental systems (e.g., specific energy values, memory parameters) to a purely theoretical paper requires frequent use of "N/A" or qualitative/implicit assessments, which reduces the utility of those specific probes for this paper type.
        *   Distinguishing Implicit/Explicit/Mixed/Inferred requires careful judgment, especially regarding concepts central to the theory but defined via citations.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very comprehensive but potentially overly detailed for purely theoretical work where much implementation data is absent. Modules M11 (Review) and M12 (Theoretical) help tailor it, but core modules (M2, M3, M5 etc.) still contain many probes requiring N/A. Perhaps a streamlined version for theoretical papers focusing on conceptual structure, arguments, and potential mappings could be beneficial. The explicit requirement to include all sections even if N/A maintains structure but adds length.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Modify M13.1 calculation or interpretation for theoretical papers.
        *   Provide clearer examples/rubrics for CT concepts like Yoneda Embedding and Monads if they are deemed essential.
        *   Consider adding an "Abstraction Level" score or category.
        *   Clarify how abstract theoretical constructs map to nodes/edges.
