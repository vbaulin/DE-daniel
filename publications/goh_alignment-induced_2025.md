## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system consists of N spherical microswimmers (squirmers) simulated in a three-dimensional fluid environment using the Multiparticle Collision Dynamics (MPC) technique. Each squirmer possesses self-propulsion (characterized by speed v0 and active stress β, differentiating pushers β<0 and pullers β>0) and autonomous self-steering capabilities. The steering mechanism allows squirmers to align their propulsion direction (e_i) towards the average orientation (e_aim,i) of neighboring squirmers within a defined sensing range (R_a), mimicking a Vicsek-like alignment interaction embedded in hydrodynamic interactions. The steering is achieved by adaptive non-axisymmetric surface flows (C11, C̃11) controlled by the alignment goal, with a maneuverability strength C0 (or dimensionless γ). The purpose is to study the emergent collective self-organization dynamics (e.g., turbulence, clustering, vortex formation, jets) arising from the interplay of hydrodynamic interactions, active stress (pusher/puller type), and local alignment steering in 3D. Components include spherical squirmers, the MPC fluid, the alignment sensing mechanism (neighbor averaging within R_a), the steering surface flow mechanism, and excluded-volume interactions (Lennard-Jones).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Collective microswimmers, `domain`: Active Matter Physics/Soft Matter, `mechanism`: Hydrodynamic interaction + Alignment-based Steering, `components`: Squirmers (pushers/pullers), MPC Fluid, Vicsek-like Alignment Rule, Steering Surface Flows, Lennard-Jones Potential, `purpose`: Study emergent collective dynamics (turbulence, clusters, vortices, jets) from local rules. Connects to `ParticleNode` (Squirmer) via `ContainsEdge`. Squirmers interact via `InteractionEdge` (Hydrodynamic, Alignment, Steric).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The system description, components, mechanisms (hydrodynamic interactions, self-propulsion equations 1-2, steering equations 3-6), and purpose are explicitly stated throughout the Introduction and Section II.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The paper provides a very clear description of the squirmer model (Eqs. 1-7), the hydrodynamic Vicsek model concept (Sec II), the MPC simulation method (Appendix A), squirmer dynamics and coupling (Appendix A.2), steric interactions (Appendix B), and parameter definitions (Eq. 7, Appendix C). Extensive appendices detail the simulation methods and parameters. Large-scale simulations are mentioned with specific parameters (L/a, N). The description of how steering is implemented via surface flows (Eqs. 1-4) and linked to alignment goal (Eqs. 5-6) is explicit. A minor deduction could be made as some detailed MPC parameters (e.g., collision time h, cell size a relative to physical units) require referencing Appendix A, but the overall implementation framework is very well-defined.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The implementation details are explicitly provided in Section II and extensively in Appendices A and B, including governing equations and simulation methodology.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Péclet number (Pe) | 32, 128 | dimensionless | Eq. (7), Sec II | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Maneuverability (γ) | 0 - 8192 | dimensionless | Eq. (7), Sec II | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Active Stress (β) | -3 (Pusher), 3 (Puller) | dimensionless | Sec II, pg 3 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Sensing Range (R_a) | 4 * R_sq | Length (relative to R_sq) | Sec II, pg 3 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Packing Fraction (ρ) | 0.012 - 0.186 | dimensionless | Sec II, pg 3 & Fig 2(h), Fig 3(g,h) | Explicit | High | N/A |

    *   **Note:** These parameters fundamentally define the system's behavior and are systematically varied or specified. R_sq (squirmer radius) is set relative to MPC cell size `a` (R_sq = 3a, Appendix A.3), providing a length scale.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The energy input is implicitly the energy consumed by each squirmer to maintain its self-propulsion speed v0 against viscous drag and to generate the steering surface flows. This originates from an unspecified internal energy source analogous to metabolic processes in microorganisms or stored energy in microrobots. The model does not explicitly define an energy source or consumption rate.
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Implicit Internal (Chemo-mechanical), `type`: Continuous Power
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper focuses on the resulting dynamics (kinematics, structure) rather than the energetics. Self-propulsion speed v0 is prescribed (Eq. 1), implying continuous energy input to overcome drag, but the source and magnitude are not specified.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: 1. Internal Energy -> Mechanical Work: Squirmers convert internal energy into mechanical work to generate tangential surface flows (Eqs. 1-2, defining u_theta, u_phi). 2. Mechanical Work -> Kinetic Energy (Fluid & Squirmers): The surface flows exert forces on the surrounding fluid, causing squirmer propulsion (translational KE), rotation (rotational KE due to steering), and fluid motion (fluid KE). Hydrodynamic interactions mediate energy transfer between squirmers via the fluid.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: `mechanism`: Chemo-Mechanical Propulsion/Steering, `from_node`: `EnergyInputNode`, `to_node`: `ParticleNode` (Squirmer KE), `FluidNode` (Fluid KE). `EnergyTransductionEdge`: `mechanism`: Hydrodynamic Interaction, `from_node`: `ParticleNode` / `FluidNode`, `to_node`: `ParticleNode` / `FluidNode`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The mechanisms are implicit in the definition of the squirmer model (surface flows generating motion) and the use of hydrodynamic simulations (MPC), which inherently model momentum/energy transfer through the fluid. The paper does not explicitly detail the energy transformation pathway.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not analyze or quantify the efficiency of energy conversion (internal to kinetic) or propulsion. Metrics like hydrodynamic efficiency are not calculated.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
      *  Justification: No discussion of energy efficiency.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Energy is dissipated primarily through viscous friction within the MPC fluid as squirmers move and stir the fluid (hydrodynamic interactions). This is inherent to the MPC simulation method which models a fluid with viscosity (given as η = 42.6 sqrt(m*k_B*T)/a in Appendix A.3). Thermal fluctuations, modeled by the thermostat in MPC (Appendix A.1) and contributing to rotational diffusion D_R, also represent energy exchange/dissipation with a thermal bath. The Lennard-Jones potential represents conservative interactions, not dissipation. Quantification of dissipation rates is not provided, but its presence is qualitatively High due to the viscous fluid environment at low Reynolds number.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode` (Viscous Friction, Thermal Bath). `EnergyDissipationEdge` from `ParticleNode` (KE) and `FluidNode` (KE) to `EnergyDissipationNode`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Dissipation mechanisms are inherent consequences of modeling motion in a viscous fluid (MPC) and including thermal effects (D_R, thermostatting), but dissipation rates are not explicitly calculated or discussed. Viscosity value is explicitly given.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system's behavior at any time step depends only on the current positions and orientations of the squirmers and their neighbors (for alignment rule Eq. 6) and the resulting fluid flow field. There is no internal state variable or mechanism within the squirmers or the fluid that stores information about past states or interactions to modify future *rules* or *responses* in a way that persists beyond the immediate dynamics. While the current configuration is a result of past evolution, there is no memory encoding in the sense required for learning or adaptation based on history.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The governing equations (1-7) and simulation description define a system whose evolution depends only on the current state. The absence of any explicit memory mechanism or discussion of history-dependent parameter changes implies no memory in the cognitive sense.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly studies the emergence of collective phenomena (active turbulence, clustering, vortices, jets - Figs 2, 3, 4) from the local interactions (hydrodynamics, alignment steering via Eqs 1-6) between individual squirmers. These large-scale patterns are not directly imposed but arise spontaneously from the prescribed local rules and interactions within the system. The title and abstract emphasize "Alignment-induced self-organization".
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The central theme and findings of the paper revolve around the self-organization processes described and analyzed (e.g., Sec I states goal is to "unravel the emergent collective behavior", Sec III title "PUSHERS: ACTIVE TURBULENCE VIA SELF-STEERING", Sec IV title "PULLERS: SWARMING DYNAMICS VIA SELF-STEERING").

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content:
        1.  **Hydrodynamic Interaction:** Mediated by the MPC fluid. Squirmers generate flow fields via surface slip (Eqs. 1-2, determined by v0, β). These flows affect neighboring squirmers' translation and rotation. Squirmers also experience forces and torques from the flow generated by others. This is implicitly modeled by the MPC simulation coupling squirmers and fluid particles (Appendix A).
        2.  **Alignment Steering:** Each squirmer `i` calculates a target orientation `e_aim,i` based on the average orientation of neighbors `j` within distance `R_a` (Eq. 6). It then generates adaptive surface flows (non-axisymmetric terms in Eqs. 1-2, determined by `C_11`, `C̃_11` via Eqs. 3-4) that produce a torque causing rotation towards `e_aim,i` with an angular velocity `ω_i = C_0 * e_i × e_aim,i` (Eq. 5). The strength is controlled by C0 (or dimensionless γ).
        3.  **Steric Repulsion:** Short-range excluded volume interaction modeled by a shifted Lennard-Jones potential to prevent overlap (Eq. B1, Appendix B).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Part of the `InteractionEdge` description between `ParticleNode`s. Types: `Hydrodynamic`, `AlignmentSteering`, `Steric`. Attributes include parameters like β, γ, R_a, LJ parameters. Defines the "LocalInteraction" category of edges.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: Equations 1-6 and B1 explicitly define the self-propulsion, steering alignment, and steric rules. Hydrodynamic interactions are explicitly modeled via the MPC method detailed in Appendix A.

    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------ | :---------- | :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------: | :----------------: | :------------: |
    | Hydro | Active Stress | β | -3, 3 | dimensionless | Sec II | Explicit | Defines pusher/puller flow field type |
    | Align | Alignment Strength | γ (or C0) | 0 - 8192 | dimensionless | Sec II, Eq 7 | Explicit | Controls rate of alignment steering |
    | Align | Sensing Range | R_a | 4 * R_sq | Length | Sec II | Explicit | Defines neighborhood for alignment |

    | Steric | Effective diameter | σ_0 (= 2*R_sq + 2*d_v) | N/A (derived from R_sq, d_v) | Length | App B | Explicit | Range of steric repulsion |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: Global polar order does *not* emerge (Fig 1d). Instead, different types of dynamic, self-organized structures emerge depending on the squirmer type (β) and maneuverability (γ):
        *   **Pushers (β < 0):** Active turbulence characterized by nearly homogeneous density, Gaussian velocity distributions (Fig 5b), collective vortical flows (Fig 2a-II), and power-law decay in the energy spectrum E(k) ~ k^-ν (Fig 2e).
        *   **Pullers (β > 0):** Swarming dynamics characterized by strong density clustering (Fig 3a-I, 3b), non-Gaussian velocity/vorticity distributions with fat tails (Fig 5b, 5c), and the dynamic formation and dissolution of vortex rings and fluid jets (Fig 3a-II, Fig 4).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `ConfigurationalNode` types: `ActiveTurbulence (Pusher)`, `ClusteredSwarm (Puller)`, `VortexRingState (Puller)`, `JetState (Puller)`. System transitions between these states or resides within one.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The emergent global states (turbulence for pushers, clusters/vortices/jets for pullers) are the main findings, explicitly described and analyzed in Sections III, IV, and V, and shown in figures. The lack of global polar order is stated in Sec II & Abstract.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 3
    *   Justification: The paper describes the emergent dynamics as "chaotic" for pullers (Abstract, Sec IV Intro) and characteristic of "active turbulence" for pushers (Sec III Intro), implying low predictability of the detailed microstate evolution. While the *type* of global order (turbulence vs. clustering) is predictable based on parameters (β, γ), the specific configuration (positions of vortices, clusters shape/location) at a future time is inherently unpredictable due to the chaotic/turbulent nature. Statistical properties (distributions, spectra, correlations) are predictable and analyzed, but not the exact state. No quantitative measures of predictability (e.g., Lyapunov exponents) are provided.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: The paper explicitly uses terms like "chaotic dynamics" (Abstract, Sec IV Intro for pullers) and "active turbulence", implying unpredictability. However, the *statistical* predictability is demonstrated through consistent results (spectra, distributions). Quantitative predictability metrics are absent.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes to the `TransitionEdge` properties between `ConfigurationalNode` states (characterizing chaotic/stochastic nature).

### **4.5. Local Interaction Rules (for Self-Organization)**
* **Vector ID:** M4.5
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Rule ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |

| Property ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Protocol | Source |

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | Local Rules -> Global Behavior | Mapping from hydrodynamic/alignment interactions to emergent turbulence (pushers) or clusters/vortices (pullers). | Low (Chaotic/Turbulent) | N/A | N/A | Implicit | The paper demonstrates the emergence but does not formally analyze the local-to-global mapping predictability or apply Yoneda embedding concepts. | N/A |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** N/A
    *   **Justification:** The concept of Yoneda embedding or a formal analysis of the local-to-global mapping fidelity is not present in the paper. The focus is on describing the emergent phenomena resulting from the local rules.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system exhibits complex self-organization and dynamics based on physical interactions (hydrodynamics, alignment). However, there is no indication that these physical processes are structured or utilized to perform specific, encoded computational tasks (e.g., logic operations, arithmetic, problem-solving) intrinsic to the material/fluid system itself. The behavior emerges from physics, but it isn't framed as or demonstrably performing computation in the usual sense.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper focuses on emergent physical patterns and dynamics (turbulence, swarming) resulting from physical rules, not on computational tasks being performed by the system. The absence of any mention of computational function implies its absence.

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Rotational Diffusion Time (τ_R = 1/D_R) | ~24390 (Derived) | a * sqrt(m / k_B T) | App A.3 (for D_R) | Mixed | D_R value given, τ_R derived. Sets thermal reorientation timescale. |
        | Alignment Response Time (τ_Align ~ 1/C0) | Varies (γ=C0/DR) | (τ_R units) | Eq. 5, Eq. 7 | Implicit | Inverse of alignment strength C0 sets the timescale for intentional reorientation. Depends on γ. |
        | Hydrodynamic Interaction Time | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Timescale for hydrodynamic forces/torques to propagate and affect neighbors. Depends on distance, fluid viscosity. Not quantified. |
        | Collective Structure Lifetime (e.g., vortex ring) | ~0.1 / D_R (Example) | (τ_R units) | Fig 4(c) caption | Explicit | Example lifetime shown for a specific event. Statistical distributions not provided. |
        | Simulation Time Step (Δt = h) | 0.02 | a * sqrt(m / k_B T) | Appendix A.2.a | Explicit | Discretization time for dynamics integration. |

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system does not exhibit active inference. Squirmers react to the *current* average orientation of neighbors (Eq. 6) and the instantaneous fluid flow. There is no evidence of internal models, prediction of future states, or action selection aimed at minimizing prediction error or surprise. The alignment goal e_aim,i is based purely on sensing the present state of neighbors.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The model description (Sec II) lacks any components related to prediction, internal models, or error minimization, which are hallmarks of active inference. The behavior is purely reactive based on current local information.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The squirmers' behavior (self-propulsion speed v0, active stress β, alignment strength C0/γ) and structure are fixed throughout the simulation. They respond to their environment (neighbors, fluid flow) according to fixed rules (Eqs 1-6), but they do not change their internal parameters or rules based on past experience to improve performance or alter functionality over time. The observed dynamics are emergent self-organization, not adaptation or learning.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The model definition in Sec II and Appendix A describes particles with fixed properties (v0, β, C0, R_sq, R_a). There is no mechanism or discussion of these parameters changing over time based on system history.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content:
        *   **Pushers (β<0):** Exhibit collective motion characterized as **Active Turbulence**. This includes formation of transient vortices, enhanced velocity fluctuations (speed up compared to v0), nearly homogeneous density distribution, and specific statistical signatures like Gaussian velocity distributions and power-law energy spectra (E(k) ~ k^-ν). (Sec III, Fig 2)
        *   **Pullers (β>0):** Exhibit dynamic **Swarming and Clustering**. This involves the formation of dense, mobile clusters with complex morphology, significant density inhomogeneity, strong fluid flows (jets) generated by aligned clusters, and the transient formation of **Vortex Rings**. Velocity and vorticity distributions deviate significantly from Gaussian, showing fat tails. Dynamics are described as chaotic. (Sec IV, V, Figs 3, 4, 5)
        *   **Both:** Lack of global polar order despite local alignment rule. (Sec II, Fig 1d)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: `ActiveTurbulence`, `Swarming/Clustering`, `VortexRingFormation`, `JetFormation`. Associated with `ConfigurationalNode`s.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These emergent behaviors are the principal findings of the paper, explicitly described, analyzed, and visualized in Sections III, IV, V and the corresponding figures.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper demonstrates that the distinct emergent behaviors (turbulence for pushers, clustering/swarming for pullers) are robust across a range of key parameters: Péclet number (Pe=32 vs 128 yield similar scaling exponents ν and scaled advection speeds v_ad/Pe for pushers - Fig 2f), maneuverability (γ, distinct regimes observed as γ increases - Figs 2b,e,f, 3b,e,f), and density (qualitative behavior persists over a range of ρ, though magnitudes change - Figs 2h, 3g,h). Finite-size effect analysis (Appendix H, Fig 10) shows convergence for large systems, indicating robustness against system size limitations. However, robustness against other perturbations like external noise (beyond thermal), structural defects, or component heterogeneity is not tested. The score reflects robustness to parameter variations shown, but lack of testing against other factors.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Robustness is explicitly shown through simulations varying Pe, γ, and ρ. Robustness against system size is shown in Appendix H. Robustness against other types of perturbations is implicitly not tested as it's not mentioned.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: This score contributes to the reliability attributes of the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Validation relies on large-scale mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations (MPC). Evidence includes:
        *   **Visualizations:** Snapshots and movies showing collective structures (Figs 2a, 3a, 4a, 4c, Movies S1-S6).
        *   **Statistical Analysis:** Calculation of standard metrics used in active matter and fluid dynamics:
            *   Global Polar Order Parameter (Fig 1d).
            *   Spatial Velocity Correlation Functions (Figs 2b, 3f, 6).
            *   Local Density Distributions (via Voronoi tessellation, Figs 2c, 3b, 3g).
            *   Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) (Figs 2d, 3c).
            *   Kinetic Energy Spectra (Figs 2e,g,h, 3e,h).
            *   Velocity and Vorticity Distributions (Fig 5b,c).
        *   **Parameter Dependence:** Demonstrating consistent emergence of behaviors across varied Pe, γ, ρ (Sec III, IV, Figs 2, 3).
        *   **Comparison:** Contrasting pusher vs. puller behavior, and wet vs. dry systems (Fig 1d).
        *   **Finite-Size Analysis:** Checking for convergence with system size (App H, Fig 10).

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: None. The paper uses terms like "autonomously steering" and "intelligent microswimmers" (title, abstract, intro), referencing the ability to sense neighbors and adapt orientation. However, it does not attempt to map the observed emergent behaviors (turbulence, clustering, vortex rings) to specific cognitive processes like decision-making, learning, planning, or problem-solving. The focus remains firmly on the physics of collective motion and self-organization. The term "intelligent" seems to refer primarily to the feedback loop between sensing and steering action, not higher cognitive functions.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    * Justification: The paper does not draw analogies or map the system's functions to cognitive concepts beyond the basic sense-and-steer capability implied by "intelligent".

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates Level 1 (Simple Responsivity - steering based on neighbor orientation) and elements of Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity - complex collective patterns like turbulence and swarming emerge from local interactions). However, it lacks key features of higher cognitive levels: memory impacting future rules/responses (needed for L3+), internal models or goal-directedness beyond local alignment (needed for L4+), adaptation/learning (rules are fixed, precluding L3+), and any form of computation or representation manipulation. The complex emergent dynamics are a result of physics, not deliberative cognitive processes as defined in the scale. The term "intelligent microswimmers" in the paper refers to the local sensing and steering capability, aligning best with Level 1/2.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Inferred
    *  Justification: The score is based on comparing the system's explicitly described features (fixed rules, reactive steering, complex emergent physics) against the definitions in the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale.

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not explicitly investigate or claim that the system operates near a critical point in the sense of statistical mechanics phase transitions (e.g., critical slowing down, diverging correlation lengths beyond those typical of turbulence/clustering, specific critical exponents unrelated to fluid dynamics). While power laws appear in the energy spectra (Fig 2e, 3e), these are characteristic features of turbulent or complex fluid flows (Kolmogorov-like scaling or deviations thereof) rather than necessarily indicating proximity to a thermodynamic critical point. The focus is on the nature of the self-organized dynamic states (turbulence, clusters), not criticality itself.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: Absence of discussion regarding criticality, phase transitions, or associated phenomena like diverging correlation lengths or critical exponents beyond those intrinsic to the observed turbulent/swarming states.

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The paper employs a well-established theoretical framework (squirmer models, Vicsek-like alignment) and simulation methodology (MPC). The model equations are clearly presented (Eqs 1-7, B1). Assumptions are stated (e.g., spherical squirmers, specific form of alignment rule). Large-scale simulations with significant particle numbers (up to N~880k) and system sizes (up to L=1024a) are used to ensure statistical relevance and minimize finite-size effects (Appendix H). Standard analysis techniques from fluid dynamics and active matter are rigorously applied (correlation functions, energy spectra, MSD, Voronoi tessellation - Appendix E). Appendices provide substantial detail on the methods. The distinction between pusher/puller types based on β is physically grounded.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: The methods, equations, parameters, and analysis techniques are explicitly detailed in the main text and appendices.

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The model components have analogues in real systems. Squirmer models approximate various microorganisms (bacteria, algae) and artificial microswimmers (Janus particles). Hydrodynamic interactions are fundamental at low Reynolds numbers. Alignment interactions can be engineered in microrobotic systems or may arise implicitly in biological systems through mechanisms not modeled here (e.g., chemical signaling, coordinated flagellar beating). Steering mechanisms exist in microorganisms and are being developed for microrobots (Appendix C, D provide estimates). The specific implementation via adaptive surface flows (Eqs 1-5) is a simplification, but the principle of steered motion based on neighbor sensing is feasible. Achieving the specific quantitative parameter ranges (Pe, γ) simultaneously might be challenging but plausible within the known range for microswimmers (Appendix C).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The paper explicitly bases the model on physical principles relevant to microswimmers. Appendices C and D explicitly discuss experimental parameter ranges. The feasibility of the *exact* combined parameter set and steering mechanism is implicitly plausible but not guaranteed.

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework provides a clear link between well-defined local rules (hydrodynamics, alignment steering - M4.2) and complex emergent global behaviors (turbulence, swarming, vortices - M4.3, M8.1). This makes it suitable for CT-GIN analysis focusing on self-organization (M4) and emergent behavior (M8). The system parameters (Pe, γ, β, ρ - M1.3) can be systematically varied to explore the phase space of behaviors. However, the model currently lacks intrinsic memory (M3), computation (M5), and adaptation (M7), limiting its exploration potential for higher cognitive functions within the CT-GIN framework without significant model extensions. Its strength lies in providing a rich physical system for studying the emergence of complex collective dynamics from simple agent rules.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Inferred
    *   Justification: The score is based on assessing the model's features (clear rules, complex emergent dynamics, tunable parameters) against the scope of the CT-GIN framework, identifying its strengths (self-organization, emergence) and weaknesses (lack of memory, computation, adaptation).

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a high-fidelity computational study of self-organization in a physically-grounded model of autonomously steering microswimmers. Its key strength within the CT-GIN framework lies in the clear definition of local interaction rules (hydrodynamics, alignment steering) leading to rigorously characterized emergent global behaviors (active turbulence, swarming, clustering, vortex rings), particularly highlighting the role of active stress (pusher vs. puller). The implementation clarity and theoretical rigor are high, and the model demonstrates robustness to variations in key physical parameters (Pe, γ, ρ). However, the system significantly lacks features relevant to higher levels of material intelligence as defined by CT-GIN. It possesses no intrinsic memory affecting future rules, performs no embodied computation, and exhibits no adaptive plasticity or learning. Consequently, its cognitive proximity is low (Level 2), primarily reflecting complex responsivity and self-organization rather than cognitive processing. While providing a valuable physics-based model of collective behavior, its current CT-GIN readiness is limited by the absence of these cognitive primitives. It serves as an excellent baseline physical system onto which minimal cognitive elements could potentially be added.

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Introduce Memory:** Implement an internal state variable for each squirmer (e.g., representing fatigue, stored resource, or past average alignment quality) that modulates its parameters (e.g., v0, C0) or influences the alignment rule (e.g., weighting recent neighbors more).
        *   **Enable Adaptation/Learning:** Allow the alignment strength (γ) or sensing range (R_a) to adapt locally based on experienced conditions (e.g., increase γ in disordered regions, decrease in ordered ones; adjust R_a based on density) using a simple reinforcement or feedback rule.
        *   **Explore Embodied Computation:** Investigate if specific configurations or interactions (e.g., vortex collisions, cluster dynamics) could be interpreted or harnessed as rudimentary logic gates or computational primitives under specific input conditions (e.g., imposed external flows).
        *   **Introduce Goal-Directedness:** Define a global objective beyond local alignment (e.g., collective transport, pattern formation) and modify local rules to incorporate feedback related to achieving this goal (linking to Active Inference principles).
        *   **Quantify Robustness:** Systematically test the robustness of emergent states against different types of noise (e.g., stochasticity in steering, variations in v0) and structural heterogeneity (e.g., distribution of particle sizes or β values).
        *   **Analyze Energetics:** Quantify energy input required for propulsion/steering and energy dissipation rates to assess overall system efficiency under different dynamic regimes.

        *   A probe assessing the *mechanism of information transfer* between components could be valuable (e.g., hydrodynamic signal propagation speed/decay, range of alignment influence).
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Adaptive Plasticity" (M7) and complex "Responsivity" (M9.3 'Sensing/Perception' + 'Decision-Making/Planning' + 'Goal-Directed Behavior' scores > 0) could be ambiguous for systems with sophisticated feedback loops but no explicit learning rule change. Clearer examples or boundary conditions might help. In this paper, the steering *is* adaptive in the common language sense, but not in the template's sense of plasticity/learning.
        *   "Embodied Computation" (M5) definition is good ("intrinsic to physical properties"), but distinguishing complex emergent dynamics *from* computation needs careful application. Perhaps adding criteria like "performs a specific, definable computational task" would clarify.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on representing continuous fields (like the fluid velocity/vorticity or density) in a discrete graph structure could be helpful. Should these be attributes of a global `SystemNode` or a dedicated `FieldNode`?
        *   Mapping interaction rules (M4.2) which are often equations or complex descriptions onto edge attributes needs clear conventions. Perhaps dedicated `RuleNode`s linked by edges?
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Assigning the Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) and checklist scores (M9.3) for purely physical simulations like this one feels somewhat forced, as the system inherently lacks most cognitive features. The scale works, but applying it highlights the vast gap between complex physics and cognition.
        *   Quantifying Predictability (M4.4) and Robustness (M8.2) often requires data not explicitly calculated in the paper (e.g., Lyapunov exponents, perturbation analysis), leading to qualitative assessments based on inference. The template should acknowledge this limitation more explicitly.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Extracting implicit information (e.g., energy flow M2, timescales M6.1) requires careful reading and inference, which is inherent to the task but time-consuming.
        *   Ensuring consistency between related fields (e.g., M4.1 'Yes' implies M4.2 and M4.3 should be filled) is crucial.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very detailed and comprehensive, which is excellent for rigor. However, its length and the conditional nature of sections (M3, M4, M5, M7, M11, M12) require careful navigation. The strict formatting is essential for machine parsing but demanding for manual completion. The distinction between node/edge mapping and content description is clear.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Consider adding a field for "Computational Goal" under M5 if M5.1 is Yes, to specify *what* computation is being performed.
        *   Perhaps consolidate optional memory fields (M3.4-M3.8) into a single table for brevity if memory is present but details are sparse.
        *   Clarify if CT-GIN mapping should represent the *ideal* abstracted system or the *specific implementation details* (e.g., should MPC fluid particles be nodes?). I assumed the former (abstracted FluidNode).
