*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system is a theoretical model of a single self-propelled agent (active Brownian particle - ABP) moving in two dimensions at a constant speed `w`. The agent's position `r(t)` and heading angle `θ(t)` are governed by overdamped Langevin equations, including translational (`Dt`) and rotational (`Dθ`) diffusion, and potentially a stationary external flow field `v(r)`. Crucially, the agent possesses feedback control over its heading: it exerts a self-generated torque proportional to `κ * Γ(θ,r)` attempting to align its heading `θ` with a predefined, position-dependent steering policy direction `θ*(r)`, where `Γ(θ,r) = -sin[θ - θ*(r)]`. The purpose is to study the stochastic thermodynamics of this controlled motility, specifically deriving the relationship between the energy dissipated for steering control (quantified by entropy production rate `S˙c`) and the accuracy of localisation (quantified by spatial variance `σ²`) near a target region (point or line). The model explores optimal steering policies that minimize energy expenditure for a given accuracy.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Theoretical/Computational, `domain`: Active Matter/Stochastic Thermodynamics, `mechanism`: Langevin Dynamics with Feedback Control, `components`: [ABP, SteeringPolicy, NoiseSources, ExternalFlow (optional)], `purpose`: Analyze Dissipation-Accuracy Tradeoff in Autonomous Navigation. `AgentNode` attributes: `speed` (w), `translationalDiffusion` (Dt), `rotationalDiffusion` (Dθ). `PolicyNode` attributes: `function` (u*(r)), `strength` (κ). `EnvironmentNode` attributes: `dimension`: 2D, `flowField` (v(r)).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The system components, dynamics (Eqs. 1, 2), control mechanism (Eq. 3), and purpose are explicitly stated in the Abstract, Introduction, and Section 2.1.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The theoretical model (Langevin equations, Fokker-Planck equation, steering function) is described with high clarity using precise mathematical formulations (Eqs. 1-5). The thermodynamic interpretation (entropy production, Eq. 6-7) is clearly laid out. The approximation scheme (gradient expansion, Section 2.2) is explained, although complex. The specific scenarios (point target, target path, different flows, specific policies like AAP, CAAP) are clearly defined. Simulation methods (Langevin simulations) are mentioned as validation tools. Minor deductions for the inherent complexity of the gradient expansion derivation details deferred to appendices.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The clarity stems directly from the explicit mathematical definitions, theoretical derivations, and descriptions provided throughout the text, particularly in Section 2.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Self-propulsion speed | `w` | Length/Time | Eq. (1) | Explicit | High (Model Definition) | N/A |
        | Translational Diffusion Coefficient | `Dt` | Length²/Time | Eq. (1) | Explicit | High (Model Definition) | N/A |

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The energy input is implicitly modeled through the active forces driving self-propulsion (characterized by speed `w`) and the active torque enabling steering control (characterized by strength `κ`). The paper does not specify the underlying physical mechanism (e.g., chemical fuel) but treats `w` and `κ` as parameters defining the active processes that consume energy and perform work against dissipative forces (diffusion, viscous drag implied by overdamped dynamics).
    *   Value: N/A (Model parameters `w` and `κ` characterize the input activity level)
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Active Processes (Self-propulsion, Steering Torque), `type`: Abstract/Implicit. Connected to `AgentNode`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper defines `w` and `κ` as parameters governing the active dynamics (Eqs. 1, 2) and links them to dissipation (Eq. 6), implying they represent energy-consuming processes, but the ultimate energy source is not explicitly modeled.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: Energy is transduced into two primary forms of work:
        1.  Work done by the self-propulsion force (`wuˆ(θ)`) against dissipative forces (implicitly, viscous drag leading to overdamped motion, and diffusion). This contributes `S˙p = Pe` (dimensionless) to the entropy production rate.
        2.  Work done by the self-generated steering torque (`κΓ(θ,r)`) to control the heading angle `θ` against rotational diffusion and potentially flow gradients (though flow effects on torque are not modeled here). This contributes `S˙c = κ˜[κ˜⟨sin²(θ−θ*)⟩−⟨cos(θ−θ*)⟩]` (dimensionless) to the entropy production rate.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge` from `EnergyInputNode` to `AgentNode` (for motion): `mechanism`: Self-Propulsion. `EnergyTransductionEdge` from `EnergyInputNode` to `AgentNode` (for orientation): `mechanism`: Steering Torque.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The decomposition of entropy production into propulsion (`S˙p`) and control (`S˙c`) components based on the active forces/torques is explicitly derived and stated in Eq. (6) and (7).

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not define or calculate a measure of thermodynamic efficiency for the task (e.g., work output / energy input, or comparison to a thermodynamic bound for localisation). It focuses on quantifying the dissipation (`S˙c`) associated with achieving a certain accuracy (`σ²`), characterizing the *cost* rather than efficiency. The derived relationship `σ²S˙c = constant` (e.g., Eq. 15) is a tradeoff, not an efficiency metric.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: Efficiency is not a concept explicitly defined or analyzed in the paper. The focus is on the dissipation cost.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Dissipation is explicitly quantified as the mean rate of entropy production (`S˙`) in the non-equilibrium steady state. It is additively decomposed into two components:
        1.  `S˙p = Pe`: Dissipation due to self-propulsion, independent of the steering policy. (Dimensionless rate).
        2.  `S˙c = κ˜[κ˜⟨sin²(θ−θ*)⟩−⟨cos(θ−θ*)⟩] ≈ -κ˜/2 ⟨∇·uˆ*⟩` (at low `κ˜`): Dissipation due to feedback control/steering. This term depends on the policy `uˆ*` and quantifies the cost of maintaining alignment and achieving localisation against noise. (Dimensionless rate).
        The physical mechanisms are the work done by the non-conservative active forces (propulsion and torque) required to maintain the non-equilibrium state against translational and rotational diffusion.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyDissipationNode` connected to `AgentNode`. Attributes: `type`: EntropyProduction. Edges: `EnergyDissipationEdge` from `AgentNode` attributes `rate_propulsion` (`S˙p`), `rate_control` (`S˙c`).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The entropy production rate (`S˙`) and its decomposition (`S˙p`, `S˙c`) are explicitly defined and calculated in Section 2.1 (Eqs. 6, 7) and further analyzed using approximations in Section 2.2 (Eq. 13).

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system's behavior (steering direction choice) is solely determined by its *current* position `r(t)` through the fixed, predefined steering policy `uˆ*(r)`. There is no mechanism described where the agent's past trajectory, experiences, or interactions modify its internal state or the steering policy itself to influence *future* steering decisions. The system state (`r`, `θ`) changes, but the *rules* governing its behavior remain constant.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: Memory is implicitly absent because the governing equations (1, 2) and the policy definition (3) show dependence only on the current state (`r`, `θ`), not on past states or history. The paper never discusses or models memory mechanisms.

**(Conditional: M3.1 is "No", skipping M3.2-M3.8)**

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: While the *target* behavior (localisation) is defined by the external steering policy `uˆ*(r)`, the actual spatial *distribution* of the agent (`P(r,θ)` or `ρ(r)`) emerges spontaneously from the local interactions defined by the Langevin dynamics (self-propulsion, steering torque, diffusion, flow) operating under that policy. The steady-state distributions (e.g., Eq. 14, 16, 20, 24, D.4) represent a global order (a specific spatial/orientational pattern) that arises from these local rules without the distribution itself being externally imposed point-by-point.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The Langevin dynamics describing local interactions are explicit. The resulting steady-state distributions are explicitly derived. The interpretation of these distributions as emergent "global order" arising from "local rules" in the context of the template's definition of self-organization is implicit.

**(Conditional: M4.1 is "Yes", including M4.2-M4.7)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The local interaction rules are defined by the coupled overdamped Langevin equations:
        1.  Position update: `r˙(t) = wuˆ(θ) + v(r) + sqrt(2Dt)ξt(t)`
        2.  Angle update: `θ˙(t) = -κ sin[θ - θ*(r)] + sqrt(2Dθ)ξθ(t)`
        These equations describe how the agent's state (`r`, `θ`) changes based on its current state, the external flow `v(r)`, the fixed steering policy `uˆ*(r) = (cos θ*(r), sin θ*(r))`, and stochastic noise (`ξt`, `ξθ`). Interactions are local in time (Markovian dynamics) and space (dependence on `r` and `θ`).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Define `LangevinDynamics` as the category for edges governing agent state transitions. `InteractionRuleNode` attributes: `equation_r` (as above), `equation_theta` (as above). Edges connect `AgentStateNode(t)` to `AgentStateNode(t+dt)`. `PolicyNode` influences `InteractionRuleNode`. `EnvironmentNode` (flow, noise) influences `InteractionRuleNode`.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The Langevin equations (1) and (2) explicitly define the local rules governing the system's dynamics.

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |

    | Eq. (1) | Position Dynamics | `w` | >0 (Constant) | Length/Time | Eq. (1) | Explicit | Model definition |
    | Eq. (1) | Position Dynamics | `Dt` | >0 (Constant) | Length²/Time | Eq. (1) | Explicit | Model definition |

    | Eq. (3) | Steering Control | `θ*(r)` | Varies (Function) | Radians | Eq. (3) | Explicit | Policy definition (specific form varies by scenario) |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The emergent global order is the non-equilibrium steady-state probability distribution `P(r,θ)` (or its marginal `ρ(r)`), which describes the statistical localisation patterns of the agent in phase space (position and orientation) or just configuration space. Examples include:
        *   Exponential localisation around a point target (`ρ(r) ∝ exp(-r/ℓ)`, Eq. 14).
        *   Modified exponential/potential-dependent localisation in radial flows (`ρ(r) ∝ exp[-V(r/ℓv) - r/ℓ]`, Eq. 16).
        *   Gaussian-like distribution with exponential tails along a target path (`ϱ(y)` given by Eq. 24, composed of Gaussian and exponential parts).
        *   Periodic density distributions along a path in periodic flows (`ϱ(x;λ)` given by Eq. D.4).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines a `SteadyStateDistributionNode`. Attributes: `type` (e.g., Exponential, GaussianExponential, Periodic), `mathematicalForm` (e.g., Eq. 14, Eq. 24). Represents the emergent configuration.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The specific forms of the steady-state distributions are explicitly derived and presented for various scenarios (e.g., Eqs. 14, 16, 20, 24, D.4).

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 10
    *   Justification: Within the model's framework and approximations (like the gradient expansion), the steady-state global order (the probability distribution) is perfectly predictable given the system parameters (`w`, `Dt`, `Dθ`, `κ`), the policy (`uˆ*`), and the flow field (`v`). The Fokker-Planck equation (Eq. 4 or Eq. 12 under approximation) deterministically governs the evolution of the probability density towards a unique steady state (assuming one exists for the given parameters). The analytical solutions derived (e.g., Eq. 14, 16, 20, 24, D.4) demonstrate this predictability. Simulations (Fig. 2a, 3a, D1a) also show good agreement with theoretical predictions within the regime of validity, confirming predictability.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: The deterministic nature of the Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution is explicit. The explicit derivation of analytical solutions demonstrates predictability within approximations. The term "predictability" in this context referring to the deterministic nature of the governing equations is an explicit feature of the model, though perfect predictability is an idealization ignoring approximation errors or simulation noise.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes to a high weight/confidence attribute on the edge linking `InteractionRuleNode` (local rules) to `SteadyStateDistributionNode` (global order).

| Localisation Accuracy (Path Target) | Variance of Orthogonal Displacement | `σy²` | >0 | L² | Explicit | Quantifies spread around target path | Calculate from `ϱs(y)` | Sec 4.1 |

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | Langevin Eq -> Steady State Dist. | Mapping from local stochastic dynamics rules to the emergent global probability distribution. | High (Deterministic PDE) | N/A | Fokker-Planck Eq. Solution | Explicit | The FPE deterministically maps local rules to the global distribution. | Sec 2.1, 2.2 |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** N/A (The concept of Yoneda embedding is not used or tested in the paper).
    *   **Justification:** The paper does not employ Category Theory concepts like the Yoneda embedding to analyze the relationship between local rules and global order. The link is described by standard statistical mechanics methods (Fokker-Planck equation).

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The agent's steering mechanism embodies a simple computational process. The term `Γ(θ,r) = -sin[θ - θ*(r)]` calculates an error signal (the sine of the angular difference between current heading `θ` and target heading `θ*(r)`). The resulting torque `κΓ` acts as a proportional control signal to reduce this error. This computation (error calculation and proportional response) is intrinsic to the physical dynamics defined for the agent model (Eq. 2), not performed by an external controller. The policy `uˆ*(r)` itself can be seen as a pre-computed function evaluation based on the input `r`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The mathematical form of the steering torque is explicit (Eq. 2, 3). Interpreting this function as an "embodied computation" (error calculation, proportional control) is implicit based on control theory analogies.

**(Conditional: M5.1 is "Yes", including M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type as `AnalogControl`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The computation involves continuous variables (angles `θ`, `θ*`) and calculates a continuous error signal (`sin(θ-θ*)`) and a continuous output (torque). There is no discretization or digital logic involved in the core feedback loop.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Error Calculation & Proportional Control. The core operation is calculating the sine of the angular error `Δθ = θ - θ*(r)` and applying a restoring torque proportional to this value (`-κ sin(Δθ)`). This is a basic form of feedback control aimed at minimizing the angular error `Δθ`. The policy evaluation `r -> θ*(r)` is also a computational step (function evaluation).
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function attribute of the `ComputationNode` as `ErrorCorrection_Proportional`. Could also define a `PolicyEvaluationNode`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The torque term `-κ sin(θ - θ*(r))` is explicit. Its interpretation as "Error Calculation & Proportional Control" is based on standard control theory terminology and is implicit in the paper.

### **5.4 Embodied Computational Units**
* **Vector ID:** M5.4
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
| Unit ID | Description | Processing Power | Energy/Operation | Freq/Resp. Time | Bit-Depth | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
| Steering Control | Calculation of `sin(θ-θ*(r))` and application of torque `-κ sin(θ-θ*(r))` | N/A | Implicitly related to `S˙c` (dissipation rate) | Response timescale related to `1/κ` and `1/Dθ` | N/A (Analog) | Sec 2.1, Eq. 7 | Mixed | Energy cost derived as dissipation S˙c; timescale inferred from parameters. Analog nature explicit. |
| Policy Evaluation | Calculation of `θ*(r)` based on current position `r` | N/A | Assumed zero cost (pre-defined function) | Instantaneous (Assumed) | N/A (Analog input/output) | Section 2.1 | Implicit | The policy is given; its evaluation cost/time is not modeled. |

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |
        | Rotational Diffusion Time | `1/Dθ` | Time | Eq. 2 | Explicit | Inverse of diffusion coefficient. Fundamental timescale. |
        | Alignment Relaxation Time | `~1/κ` (for `κ˜ >> 1`) or `~1/Dθ` (for `κ˜ << 1`) | Time | Sec 2.1, 2.2 | Implicit | Characteristic time for alignment torque to overcome/compete with diffusion. Exact value depends on `κ˜`. Timescale of feedback control. |
        | Translational Persistence Time (No flow/control) | `~1/Dθ` | Time | N/A | Inferred | Characteristic time for orientation to randomize without control, setting persistence length `w/Dθ`. |
        | Localisation/Traversal Time (Point Target, No Flow) | `~ℓ²/Dt` or `~ℓ/w` | Time | Sec 3 | Inferred | Timescale to diffuse (`ℓ²/Dt`) or actively move (`ℓ/w`) across the localisation length `ℓ`. |
        | Flow Variation Timescale (Sinusoidal Flow) | `~λ/w` | Time | Sec 4.2 | Implicit | Time for the agent moving at speed `w` to traverse one wavelength `λ` of the flow pattern. Relevant for CAAP performance. |
        | Policy Adaptation Delay (CAAP) | `~1/κ` | Time | Sec 4.2 | Implicit | The finite alignment strength `κ` introduces a delay in responding to changes in the required steering direction due to flow variations. |

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system does not exhibit active inference. It operates based on a fixed, predefined steering policy `uˆ*(r)` that maps the *current* state `r` to a target orientation `θ*`. There is no evidence of (1) prediction of future states, (2) action selection based on minimizing prediction error or surprise, or (3) an internal model of the world/environment being updated based on experience. The agent simply reacts to its present location according to the fixed policy.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The absence of prediction, internal models, or surprise minimization mechanisms in the governing equations (1, 2, 3) and the surrounding text implies the absence of active inference.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The agent's behavior is governed by fixed parameters (`w`, `Dt`, `Dθ`, `κ`) and a fixed steering policy `uˆ*(r)`. The paper does not describe any mechanism by which the agent's parameters or the steering policy itself change over time in response to experience, environment, or feedback to improve performance or alter functionality. The optimisation performed in Sec 4.1.3 is done *externally* by the researchers to find the best *fixed* policy parameters (coefficients `an`), not by the agent itself adapting its policy dynamically.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: Adaptive plasticity is implicitly absent as no mechanism for changing the rules (parameters or policy function) based on history is described in the model equations or text. The policy is explicitly stated as stationary (Sec 2.1).

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "No", skipping M7.2)**

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary emergent behaviors analyzed are:
        1.  **Localisation near a target:** The agent confines its motion statistically to the vicinity of a specific subspace (a point target in Section 3 or a line target path in Section 4). The degree of localisation (accuracy) depends on system parameters and the policy.
        2.  **Directed motion along a path:** When using policies like AAP or CAAP (Section 4), the agent exhibits net motion along the target path while simultaneously localising orthogonally to it.
        3.  **Dissipation-Accuracy Tradeoff:** A fundamental relationship emerges where increasing localisation accuracy (decreasing `σ²`) requires increased energy dissipation for control (`S˙c`) (Eqs. 15, 27).
        4.  **Optimal Navigation Strategy (Pareto Front):** For localisation along a path without flow, a set of optimal policies (coinciding with AAP) is identified that defines the Pareto front, representing the best possible tradeoff between localisation accuracy and dissipation cost (Section 4.1.3, Fig. 4).
        5.  **Escape Behavior:** Under certain conditions (e.g., strong divergent flow or uniform flow exceeding a threshold relative to alignment strength), the agent fails to localise and escapes to infinity (Sections 3, Appendix B).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: "Localisation" (attributes: `targetType` [point/path], `accuracyMetric` [σr²/σy²]), "DirectedMotion", "Tradeoff" (attributes: `quantity1` [accuracy], `quantity2` [dissipation]), "Optimality" (attributes: `criteria` [Pareto front]), "Escape".
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors (localisation, tradeoff, optimality, escape) are the central results explicitly derived, discussed, and quantified throughout the paper (Sections 3, 4, Appendices).

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The behaviors (localisation, path following) are generally robust to the presence of stochastic noise (inherent in the model). Robustness to parameter variations is implicitly explored: the dissipation-accuracy tradeoff holds across different scenarios (point/path, no flow/radial flow/uniform flow/sinusoidal flow) and policies (simple alignment, AAP, CAAP), suggesting robustness of the *tradeoff itself*. However, localisation *performance* is sensitive to parameters: accuracy (`σ²`) and dissipation (`S˙c`) depend strongly on `κ˜`, `ε`, `Pe` (Figs 2, 3, 5, 6). Crucially, localisation can fail entirely (escape) if parameters cross certain thresholds (e.g., `ℓ < ℓv` in radial flow, `vf > κ˜/2` in uniform flow, `2A/κ˜ > 1` implied for CAAP), indicating a lack of robustness outside specific parameter regimes. Performance of CAAP degrades significantly for small flow wavelengths `λ` (Fig 5b). The gradient expansion approximation itself breaks down for large `κ˜` (Fig 2c discussion).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Robustness to noise is explicit in the stochastic model framework. Sensitivity to parameters is explicitly shown in figures and discussed (e.g., escape conditions, breakdown of theory at large κ˜, dependence on λ). Qualitative assessment of overall robustness based on these observations is implicit.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Score contributes to reliability attributes of `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s. Parameter dependencies define sensitivity attributes.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Emergent behaviors are validated primarily through:
        1.  **Analytical Derivations:** Using stochastic thermodynamics and Fokker-Planck equations (often with approximations like gradient expansion) to predict steady-state distributions (`ρs`, `ϱs`), localisation accuracy (`σ²`), and dissipation (`S˙c`). Key results include explicit formulas for these quantities and the dissipation-accuracy tradeoff (Eqs. 14-18, 20-27, D.4-D.5, A.13, A.19).
        2.  **Numerical Simulations:** Direct simulation of the Langevin equations (1, 2) is used to generate trajectories and empirical distributions. These simulation results are compared quantitatively with theoretical predictions (e.g., density profiles in Fig. 2a, 3a, D1a; S˙c and σ² values in Fig. 2b, 3c, 5b, 6b, D1b). Agreement is generally good within the stated validity range of approximations (e.g., low `κ˜`, large `λ`).
        3.  **Parameter Space Exploration:** Simulations and theory explore how behaviors change across different parameters (`κ˜`, `Pe`, `ε`, flow parameters `vf`, `ℓv`, `A`, `λ`), validating predicted dependencies and identifying regimes like escape or optimality (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, D1).
        Limitations: Validation relies heavily on the gradient expansion approximation (low `κ˜`, smooth spatial variations), which breaks down in some regimes (explicitly noted for high `κ˜` in Fig 2c discussion, and for small `λ` in Fig D1b). Some results are only derived for simplified scenarios (e.g., linear flow potential, purely sinusoidal flow).
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The methods of validation (analytical derivation, numerical simulation, parameter sweeps) and the comparisons between them are explicitly described and presented throughout the text and figures. Limitations of the theoretical approach are also explicitly mentioned.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper uses terms related to goal-directed behavior, such as "autonomous control," "self-steering," "navigation," "localisation," "following a pre-defined trajectory," "steering policy," and "optimal policies." These map metaphorically to low-level cognitive functions like spatial awareness (agent uses position `r`), motor control (agent controls heading `θ`), and goal achievement (reaching/staying near target). The concept of finding "optimal policies" relates to decision-making or planning, although the optimisation is performed externally, not by the agent itself. Limitations: The mapping is purely analogous. The agent lacks internal representation beyond its current state, learning, complex planning, or any higher cognitive functions. The "policy" is externally provided, not generated by the agent.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` from `BehaviorArchetypeNode` ("Localisation", "DirectedMotion", "Optimality") to `CognitiveFunctionNode` ("Spatial Control", "Goal Achievement", "Navigation"). Attributes could include `mappingType`: Analogous, `limitations`: [Lack of internal representation, learning, planning].
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The use of terms like "navigation," "control," and "policy" is explicit. The interpretation of these as analogous to specific cognitive functions is implicit, based on common usage and the template's framing. The limitations of this analogy are implicitly clear from the model's definition (lack of learning, fixed policy).

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: The system exhibits Level 1 (Simple Responsivity) through its reaction to the environment via the steering policy. It arguably reaches Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity) as the feedback control (`-κ sin(θ-θ*)`) represents a basic form of internal regulation aimed at achieving a target state (alignment with `θ*`), leading to goal-oriented behavior (localisation). However, it lacks genuine adaptation, learning, internal models, complex representations, or flexible planning needed for higher levels. The policy is fixed, and the behavior is reactive based on the current position. The optimisation is external. It does not meet the criteria for Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy) because there is no adaptation based on experience modifying the behavioral repertoire.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is assigned based on comparing the explicitly described system capabilities (reactive control with fixed policy) against the implicit definitions provided in the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale.

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not discuss or analyze the system's behavior in the context of criticality, phase transitions, power laws, or scale-free phenomena. While there are thresholds in parameter space where behavior changes qualitatively (e.g., the onset of escape), these are presented as stability boundaries or conditions for localisation failure, not as critical points associated with diverging correlation lengths or susceptibility in the typical sense of critical phenomena.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A (The concept is not invoked in the paper).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The absence of any discussion related to criticality, power laws, or related concepts in the paper indicates its absence from the analysis.

## M11: Review Paper Specifics (Conditional)

    *   Content: N/A (Paper type is Hybrid, not Review).

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   **Vector ID:** M12
*   **Vector Type:** Theory

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework is based on well-established principles of stochastic processes (Langevin, Fokker-Planck equations) and stochastic thermodynamics (entropy production). Assumptions (e.g., overdamped dynamics, constant speed, specific noise statistics, form of steering torque) are clearly stated. Derivations of entropy production (Eq. 6, 7) and the gradient expansion (Section 2.2, Appendix A) appear mathematically sound, though complex. The derived analytical solutions for specific cases seem internally consistent. The main limitation acknowledged is the validity range of the gradient expansion (low `κ˜`, smooth variations). The link between `S˙c` and `∇·uˆ*` (Eq. 13) provides a clear, non-trivial theoretical prediction.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: The mathematical framework, assumptions, derivations, and limitations (regarding approximations) are explicitly presented in the text and appendices.

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The model describes active Brownian particles (ABPs), which are widely studied experimentally (e.g., self-propelled colloids, bacteria). Feedback control based on position is achievable in principle using external fields (e.g., magnetic, optical traps) modulated based on tracked particle position, although realizing *autonomous* self-steering based on *local* sensing and internal actuation as modeled is more challenging but conceptually plausible for engineered micro-robots or microorganisms with taxis behavior. The specific sinusoidal steering policy (Eq. 3) is a simplification but captures the essence of error-correcting feedback. Constant speed is an idealization; real systems have fluctuations. The main challenge lies in implementing the *autonomous* position sensing and precise torque generation *within* the micro-agent itself as described, rather than external control loops. However, the model captures essential physics relevant to controlling microswimmers.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: Realization potential is inferred by comparing the model components (ABP, feedback control) to existing experimental systems and considering the feasibility of implementing the described mechanisms, drawing on general knowledge of active matter and microrobotics not solely contained in the paper.

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework provides clear, quantifiable relationships between control input (related to `κ`, `uˆ*`), system dynamics (Langevin/Fokker-Planck), dissipation (`S˙c`), and performance (`σ²`). These elements map well to a CT-GIN analysis focusing on energy flow, computation (control), emergent order (distribution), and behavior (localisation, tradeoff). The decomposition of dissipation and the derivation of tradeoffs offer valuable insights into the physical costs of control and information processing in active agents, relevant to cognizant matter principles. The model is relatively simple yet captures fundamental physics, making it a good candidate for integration into larger CT-GIN models of more complex systems or multi-agent scenarios. It provides a baseline for understanding the thermodynamics of controlled active motion.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: The potential is assessed by mapping the paper's concepts and results onto the CT-GIN framework's components and goals, requiring interpretation beyond the paper's explicit scope.

### **13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.1

    *   Calculation: (M1.2=9 + M2.3=0 + M2.4_Score=10 (Quantified) + M3.1=0 + M4.1=10 (Quantified Order Parameter σ²) + M4.4=10 + M5.1=5 (Basic Computation) + M7.1=0 + M8.2=6 + M9.2=2) / 10 sections = (9+0+10+0+10+10+5+0+6+2) / 10 = 52 / 10 = 5.2 -> Re-evaluating scores more strictly based on *template definitions*: M1.2=9, M2.3=0, M2.4=10 (Explicitly Quantified), M3.1=0 -> Skip M3.x, M4.1=10 -> M4.4=10, M5.1=5 -> Skip M5.x? (No, keep M5.x if M5.1=Yes), M7.1=0 -> Skip M7.x, M8.2=6, M9.2=2. Average = (M1.2=9 + M2.3=0 + M4.4=10 + M8.2=6 + M9.2=2) / 5 = 27/5 = 5.4. Let's include all scored elements where applicable (even if 0): M1.2(9), M2.3(0), M2.4(10 - Implicit score for quantification quality), M3.1(0), M4.1(10)->M4.4(10), M5.1(5)->M5.2(N/A)-M5.3(N/A), M7.1(0), M8.2(6), M9.2(2), M10.1(0). Relevant scores: M1.2(9), M2.3(0), M4.4(10), M8.2(6), M9.2(2). Average = (9+0+10+6+2)/5 = 27/5 = 5.4. Re-read instruction: "Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2". This is ambiguous. Assume it means average of M1.2, M2.3, M3.2 (if applicable), M4.4 (if applicable), M8.2, M9.2. Here: (M1.2=9 + M2.3=0 + M4.4=10 + M8.2=6 + M9.2=2) / 5 = 5.4. Let's assume M2.4 score refers to quantification quality (10). Then (9+0+10+0(M3)+10(M4)+0(M5)+0(M6)+0(M7)+6(M8)+2(M9))/10 = 37/10? Let's stick to the instruction's listed modules: M1.2(9), M2.3(0), M3 is N/A, M4.4(10), M8.2(6), M9.2(2). Seems most reasonable is (9+0+10+6+2)/5 = 5.4.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper provides a rigorous theoretical and computational analysis of a minimal model for autonomous navigation in active matter, focusing on the fundamental tradeoff between energy dissipation (`S˙c`) and localisation accuracy (`σ²`). Key strengths lie in the clear definition of the model, the explicit quantification of dissipation using stochastic thermodynamics, and the derivation of the dissipation-accuracy tradeoff relationship under various conditions. The decomposition of entropy production into propulsion and control costs is a significant contribution. The work successfully demonstrates how basic feedback control leads to emergent localisation patterns (global order) from local stochastic rules. However, from a CT-GIN perspective focused on material intelligence, the model has significant limitations. It lacks memory, adaptive plasticity, complex computation beyond basic error correction, and active inference. The "intelligence" is limited to reactive, goal-directed behavior based on a fixed, externally defined policy. While providing a valuable foundation for understanding the thermodynamics of control in active systems, it represents a low level of cognitive proximity (Level 2). Its value lies in establishing baseline physical constraints (energy cost of accuracy) upon which more complex cognitive functions could potentially be built.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Incorporate Memory:** Introduce history dependence into the agent's state or steering policy (e.g., dependence on recent path or velocity autocorrelation).
        *   **Implement Adaptation/Learning:** Allow the agent to modify its steering policy based on experience (e.g., using reinforcement learning principles to learn optimal paths or adapt `κ` or `ε` based on perceived accuracy/cost).
        *   **Model Sensing Cost:** Explicitly model the energy cost and time delays associated with the agent sensing its position `r` to evaluate `θ*(r)`.
        *   **Explore Complex Computation:** Design policies `uˆ*` that require more complex PIDE computations embodied by the agent's internal dynamics, moving beyond simple alignment.
        *   **Investigate Multi-Agent Systems:** Extend the framework to study collective navigation, emergent pattern formation, and information sharing in groups of interacting self-steering agents.
        *   **Analyze Transient Dynamics:** Move beyond steady-state analysis to understand the dynamics of reaching the target state and the associated transient energy costs.
        *   **Refine Theory:** Develop theoretical approaches valid for stronger alignment (`κ˜ > 1`) and rapidly varying environments (small `λ`) where the current gradient expansion fails.
        *   **Bridge to Active Inference:** Explore modifications to the model that incorporate predictive internal models and action selection based on minimizing prediction errors, explicitly connecting to active inference principles.

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically asking about the *information processing cost* (beyond just energy dissipation `S˙c`) could be useful, perhaps linking to Landauer's principle or information flow metrics if derivable.
        *   A probe distinguishing between *internal feedback* (agent reacting to its own state) and *external feedback* (researcher tuning parameters based on results) might clarify adaptation scope.
        *   A section on *Thermodynamic Bounds* could be added: Does the paper compare the system's performance/cost to relevant theoretical limits (e.g., thermodynamic uncertainty relations mentioned in intro, speed limits, efficiency bounds)? This paper mentions TUR but states the regulation studied falls outside its scope.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The scope of "Self-Organization" (M4) could be slightly ambiguous when external policies guide the behavior. Clarifying whether the emergent *distribution* under a policy counts, or if it requires pattern formation *without* such explicit guidance, would be helpful. (Current interpretation assumes the former is acceptable).
        *   The averaging rule for the Overall CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) was slightly ambiguous regarding which modules' scores to include. Explicitly listing the Vector IDs (e.g., "Average of scores from M1.2, M2.3, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2") would be clearer.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:** The examples provided are helpful, but more diverse examples for different types of systems (e.g., chemical networks, material-based computation) would strengthen guidance. Specifying primary vs. secondary attributes could also help prioritize.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:** Assigning the Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on interpretation against the provided scale, which is inherently subjective. Providing more concrete examples of systems at each level (if possible) could aid calibration. Scoring Robustness (M8.2) qualitatively is also challenging; perhaps breaking it down into robustness against specific perturbation types (noise, parameter variance, structural defects) could be more structured.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:** No major difficulties encountered for this paper, as it was largely theoretical/computational with clearly defined parameters and results. Extracting implicit information requires careful reading.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very comprehensive and detailed, which is good for thorough analysis but also makes it lengthy. The conditional skipping logic helps streamline it. The strict formatting requirement is crucial but demands careful adherence.
    * **Specific Suggestions:** Add the explicit list of Vector IDs to the M13.1 calculation instruction. Consider adding a subsection under M4 specifically addressing the role of any external patterns or controls (like the policy here) in relation to the emergent order. Add a probe for comparison to thermodynamic bounds. Provide anchor examples for the Cognizance Scale (M9.2).
