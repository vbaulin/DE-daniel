## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system is an untethered, entirely soft robot ('octobot') featuring eight pneumatically actuated arms. Its components include a moulded elastomeric body, embedded fuel reservoirs (containing H2O2 monopropellant), platinum catalyst reaction chambers, pneumatic actuator networks, vent orifices, and a microfluidic logic controller fabricated using soft lithography. The robot's purpose is to demonstrate an integrated design and fabrication strategy for achieving autonomy in completely soft robots. It operates by catalytically decomposing the on-board fuel supply, generating pressurized gas that inflates actuator networks regulated by the microfluidic oscillator, resulting in alternating limb movement.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy source is chemical potential energy stored in the on-board liquid fuel, specifically 50 wt% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
    *   Value: 1.44 (Energy Density)
    *   Units: kJ g⁻¹ (Energy Density)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Chemical (H2O2), `type`: Potential Energy. Attribute `energy_density`: 1.44 kJ g⁻¹.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly identifies हाइड्रोजन पेरोक्साइड (50 wt%) as the fuel and states its energy density (1.44 kJ g⁻¹) in the main text (page 454).

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: 1. Chemical potential energy (H2O2) is converted into chemical kinetic/thermal energy via catalytic decomposition (exothermic reaction: 2H₂O₂(l) → 2H₂O(l, g) + O₂(g)) in the platinum-laden reaction chambers. 2. This generates high-pressure gas (water vapor and oxygen). The chemical/thermal energy is transduced into pneumatic potential energy (pressurized gas). 3. The pneumatic potential energy is converted into mechanical work via the inflation and deformation (bending) of the soft actuators.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge` from `ChemicalPotentialEnergyNode` to `PneumaticPotentialEnergyNode` (mechanism: catalytic decomposition, expansion). `EnergyTransductionEdge` from `PneumaticPotentialEnergyNode` to `MechanicalWorkNode` (mechanism: actuator inflation/deformation).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the catalytic decomposition reaction, the generation of pressurized gas, and the subsequent inflation and actuation of the soft limbs (Fig. 3c, main text discussion).

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification/Metrics: Efficiency is not explicitly quantified. However, based on the processes involved (exothermic reaction with heat loss, potential gas leakage, viscous losses in microfluidic channels, viscoelastic damping in actuators, energy lost through venting), the overall efficiency converting chemical energy to useful mechanical work is expected to be very low. The system prioritizes autonomy and softness over efficiency. Qualitative Assessment: Low.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `efficiency_score`: 1 (Low) of relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s (Chemical->Pneumatic, Pneumatic->Mechanical).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: The score is an inference based on the described physical processes and the lack of any efficiency measurements or claims in the paper. The focus is on demonstrating autonomy, not optimizing energy use.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Major dissipation mechanisms include: 1. Heat loss during the exothermic catalytic decomposition of H2O2 (Quantification: N/A, Qualitative: High). 2. Viscous losses as fuel flows through microfluidic channels and gas flows through pneumatic networks (Quantification: N/A, Qualitative: Medium/High, depends on flow rates/geometry). 3. Elastic hysteresis/damping within the elastomeric materials during actuation cycles (Quantification: N/A, Qualitative: Medium). 4. Energy lost through the venting of pressurized gas to the atmosphere after each actuation cycle (Quantification: N/A, Qualitative: High, necessary for cyclic operation). 5. Potential gas leakage through materials or interfaces (Quantification: N/A, Qualitative: Low/Medium, assumed minimized by design).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode`s (e.g., HeatLoss, ViscousLoss, DampingLoss, VentingLoss) and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s linking energy transformation steps to these nodes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: These dissipation mechanisms are inherent to the described physical processes (chemical reactions, fluid flow in channels, viscoelastic materials, pneumatic venting) but are not explicitly quantified or discussed in detail regarding their magnitude in the paper.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system exhibits oscillatory behavior determined by the microfluidic circuit design and fluid dynamics. While the oscillator has internal states (which channel is active), these are transient parts of the operational cycle. There is no evidence that the system stores information about *past environmental interactions* or *internal states* in a persistent way that modifies its *future responses or behavior* in an adaptive manner. Material effects like the Mullins effect might cause changes in actuator response over initial cycles (mentioned in Methods), but this is characterized as a break-in effect, not functional memory used for computation or adaptation.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The absence of memory (in the cognitive/adaptive sense) is inferred from the description of the system as a pre-programmed oscillator driving actuation, with no mention of learning, adaptation based on stored history, or persistent state changes influencing future choices beyond the immediate oscillatory cycle.

**(Conditional: M3.1 is "No", skip to Module 4.)**

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Partial
    *   Justification: Self-organization is present in the *fabrication process* through the "auto-evacuation" of the fugitive ink, where water evaporation and diffusion through the matrix spontaneously create open channels (Fig 1f, Main text). However, the *functional structure* of the robot (oscillator logic, actuator network layout) is entirely *designed* and precisely patterned via moulding, soft lithography, and EMB3D printing, not self-organized. The oscillatory behavior itself emerges from the interplay of fluid dynamics, material elasticity, and the designed geometry of the microfluidic circuit, which could be considered a form of dynamic self-organization governed by local rules, but within a heavily constrained, pre-defined structure. It's not generating the structure itself.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Auto-evacuation is explicitly described as a self-driven process. The functional structure is explicitly described as designed/fabricated. The emergent nature of the oscillation from local rules within the designed structure is implicit.

**(Conditional: If M4.1 is "No", skip to Module 5. If "Yes", include M4.2-M4.7)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: 1. **Fluid Dynamics:** Pressure-driven flow (Navier-Stokes approx.) through micro/meso-scale channels, governed by channel geometry, fluid viscosity, and pressure gradients. Includes behavior of check valves (unidirectional flow) and pinch valves (occlusion based on pressure differentials) in the oscillator (Fig 3a, 3b). 2. **Reaction Kinetics:** Catalytic decomposition rate of H2O2 on Pt surface, dependent on fuel concentration, catalyst surface area, and temperature (implicitly). Produces gas leading to pressure increase. 3. **Elastic Mechanics:** Deformation of elastomeric actuators and reservoirs in response to internal pressure (pressure-volume relationship, bending mechanics based on geometry and material modulus differences) (Fig 4a, 4b). 4. **Mass Transport (Auto-evacuation):** Diffusion of water from fugitive ink through the PDMS matrix driven by concentration gradient and temperature (Extended Data Fig. 5).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Rules define attributes of `AdjunctionEdge`s between components (e.g., `fluid_dynamics` between channel segments, `reaction_kinetics` in chambers, `elastic_mechanics` in actuators). Auto-evacuation is a process rule relevant during fabrication.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: Fluidic valve behavior is explicitly discussed (building on ref 11). Reaction kinetics and elastic mechanics are implicitly governed by standard physics/chemistry principles applied to the system. Auto-evacuation mechanism (diffusion) is explicitly mentioned. Detailed equations are not provided in this paper.

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The primary emergent global order (dynamic) is the rhythmic, alternating actuation of the two sets of four arms (red vs. blue states in Fig 4c, 4d). This macroscopic oscillation arises from the designed microfluidic logic and the coupled chemo-pneumatic processes. During fabrication, the global order is the patterned, monolithic robot structure itself, achieved via designed deposition and self-assembly (auto-evacuation).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines a `ConfigurationalNode` representing the oscillatory actuation pattern. Attributes might include `frequency`, `amplitude`, `phase`. Also represents the final robot structure `ConfigurationalNode`.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The alternating actuation is explicitly described and shown (Fig 4c, 4d, Ext. Data Fig. 8). The final robot structure is the explicit outcome of the fabrication process.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The oscillatory behavior is designed and generally predictable ("soft controller alternates actuation states as expected"). However, the paper notes variability: "operated autonomously... cycling between actuation states for four to eight minutes. Although this is less than the predicted theoretical run time...". Departure from theory is attributed to downstream impedances and decreasing fuel flow rate. This indicates reasonable predictability under ideal conditions but sensitivity to operational factors and potential variations, preventing a perfect score. Quantitative predictability metrics are not provided.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: Predictability ("as expected") is explicitly stated. Deviations and sensitivities are also explicitly mentioned. The score is an interpretation based on these statements.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `predictability_score`: 7 for the `AdjunctionEdge` linking local oscillator rules to the global oscillatory pattern (`ConfigurationalNode`).

Assessing fidelity requires a formal CT model not present here.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The microfluidic oscillator circuit, composed of elastomeric valves (pinch and check valves), performs computation intrinsically. It uses fluidic pressure and flow dynamics within its physical structure to execute a logic function: converting a continuous pressure input into an alternating, switched flow output. This computation is embodied within the material structure and its interaction with the fluid, not performed by an external electronic controller.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the microfluidic logic controller and its function in regulating fuel flow based on internal valve states and pressure feedback (Fig 3a, ref 11). The analogy to an electrical oscillator (Fig 3b) highlights its computational nature.

**(Conditional: If M5.1 is "Yes", include M5.2-5.4)**

### **5.2 Computation Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.2
*   **Vector Type:** Classification
    *   Content: Analog/Hybrid
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type: `FluidicOscillator`. Attribute `computationType`: Analog/Hybrid.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The system operates on continuous fluid pressures and flows (analog) but involves discrete switching events between states (digital-like aspect). The paper uses an electrical oscillator analogy (Fig 3b), often considered analog, but the valve operations have threshold-like behavior. "Hybrid" reflects this mix.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Fluidic Oscillation / Flow Switching. The basic operation is the alternating diversion of fluid flow between two output channels based on internal pressure feedback mediated by check and pinch valves. This constitutes a fluidic relaxation oscillator.
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode` (`FluidicOscillator`) as `FlowSwitchingOscillation`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly describes the oscillator's function as converting pressurized inflow into alternating outflow using valves (Fig 3a, 3c, ref 11).

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system operates based on a pre-programmed oscillatory behavior determined by its fixed physical design and the immediate fluidic state. There is no evidence presented that the octobot possesses an internal model of its environment or itself, predicts future states, compares predictions to sensory input (which it largely lacks beyond internal pressures), or selects actions to minimize prediction error. Its behavior is reactive based on the oscillator's deterministic (though potentially complex) dynamics.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Inferred from the lack of any description or evidence of predictive modeling, goal-directed action selection based on prediction error, or sophisticated sensory feedback mechanisms in the paper.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not describe or provide evidence for any adaptive plasticity. The robot's behavior (alternating actuation) is fixed by its design (microfluidic circuit, materials, geometry). While material properties might slightly change over time (e.g., Mullins effect during break-in), this is not presented as a mechanism for learning or improving performance based on experience or environmental interaction. The system does not modify its structure or control logic in response to operational history to achieve different or better outcomes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: Inferred from the absence of any mention of learning, adaptation, structural modification based on experience, or changes in behavior over time (beyond initial break-in or decay).

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "No", skip to Module 8.)**

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary, directly observable functional behavior is the autonomous, rhythmic, alternating inflation and deflation (actuation) of two sets of four limbs. This results in a periodic change in the robot's shape. While designed for locomotion, the paper focuses on demonstrating the autonomous actuation cycle itself rather than effective movement across a surface.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`: `OscillatoryActuation`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: This behavior is the central demonstration of the paper, explicitly described, shown in figures (Fig 4c, 4d), and videos.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 5
    *   Justification: The paper highlights the resilience of soft robots generally (citing ref 7, 20). The fabrication process involves iterating through ~300 octobots, suggesting sensitivity to fabrication parameters. The observed run time (4-8 min) varies and is less than theoretical (12.5 min), indicating sensitivity to operational factors like downstream impedance or fuel flow decay. The system successfully performs its core function repeatedly within a run, but quantitative data on robustness to specific perturbations (e.g., external forces, temperature changes, fuel impurities, fabrication variations) is lacking. The score reflects successful demonstration but with noted variability and lack of quantified robustness testing.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: General resilience is mentioned explicitly (citing others). Variability in run time is explicitly stated. The need for many iterations implies sensitivity (implicit). Lack of specific quantitative robustness tests is evident. Score based on interpretation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `robustness_score`: 5 for the `BehaviorArchetypeNode` (`OscillatoryActuation`).

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: The primary emergent behavior (autonomous oscillation/alternating actuation) is validated through: 1. Direct observation and video recording (Supp. Videos 5, 6; Fig 4d). 2. Tracking of dyed fuel flow through the transparent/translucent body, confirming the switching action of the controller and flow to alternate limb sets (Fig 4c, Ext. Data Fig. 6, Ext. Data Fig. 8). 3. Characterization of actuator displacement vs. pressure (Fig 4b), confirming the mechanical response underlying the behavior. Reproducibility is implicitly suggested by the fabrication of nearly 300 units to converge on the design. Control experiments (e.g., disabling catalyst, altering oscillator) are not explicitly described for validating the emergence mechanism itself, though component characterization supports it. Limitations include lack of quantitative analysis of oscillation frequency/stability over time or across different units.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: Validation methods (observation, imaging, component characterization) are explicitly described or shown. Reproducibility is implied. Lack of specific control experiments for emergence is noted by absence.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper uses a functional analogy, comparing the chemo-fluidic system (fuel reservoirs, oscillator, reaction chambers, actuators, vents) to an electrical oscillator circuit (supply capacitors, electrical oscillator, amplifiers, capacitors, pull-down resistors) in Figure 3b to explain the control logic. This is an explanatory analogy, not a claim of cognitive function equivalence. No explicit mapping to biological or psychological cognitive processes is made.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines a `CognitiveMappingEdge` from `ComputationNode` (`FluidicOscillator`) and related components to `ConceptualNode` (`ElectricalOscillatorAnalogy`). Edge type: `Analogy`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The electrical analogy is explicitly presented in Figure 3b and discussed briefly in the text. The absence of other cognitive mappings is clear.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification: The system demonstrates autonomous operation based on internal power and control, fulfilling a basic requirement for embodied agents. However, its behavior is purely reactive and pre-programmed by the fixed microfluidic oscillator. It lacks sensing of the external environment (beyond implicit interaction via load on actuators), memory of past interactions influencing future behavior, learning/adaptation, goal-directedness (beyond executing the fixed oscillation), or internal modeling. The behavior corresponds to Level 1 (Simple Responsivity) on the Cognizance Scale, representing a pre-determined reaction (oscillation) triggered by fuel input, albeit complex in its implementation.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The score is based on interpreting the system's explicitly described capabilities (autonomy, fixed oscillation) and its explicitly absent capabilities (sensing, memory, learning) against the provided Cognizance Scale definitions.

**CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:** (Reference Only)

*   **Level 0: Non-Cognitive:** ...
*   **Level 1: Simple Responsivity:** Basic stimulus-response behavior. Reactions are fixed and predetermined.
*   ... (Levels 2-10) ...

    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not mention or provide any evidence suggesting that the system operates near a critical point, exhibits scale-free dynamics, follows power laws, or displays long-range correlations characteristic of critical systems.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: The octobot represents a significant step towards autonomous soft robotics by successfully integrating on-board power (chemical fuel), control (microfluidic oscillator), and actuation within a monolithic soft body. Its key strength lies in the demonstration of untethered operation using a hybrid fabrication approach combining moulding, soft lithography, and embedded 3D printing. From a CT-GIN perspective, it exhibits embodied computation through its fluidic oscillator and partial self-organization during the fabrication process (auto-evacuation). However, its cognitive capabilities are minimal (Level 1). Key limitations include the complete absence of environmental sensing, long-term memory, learning, or adaptive plasticity. The behavior is pre-programmed and reactive, lacking goal-directedness or complex decision-making. Energy efficiency is likely very low, and robustness, while qualitatively suggested, is not quantitatively assessed and shows operational variability. While demonstrating autonomy, the octobot serves as a foundational platform rather than an example of advanced material intelligence. Potential lies in integrating more sophisticated fluidic logic, sensors, and adaptive materials.

### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Integrate Sensing:** Incorporate soft sensors (e.g., strain, pressure, chemical) to provide feedback about the environment and internal state, enabling closed-loop control.
        *   **Implement Memory:** Explore materials or structures capable of persistent state changes (e.g., phase-change materials, bistable mechanisms, adaptive polymers) integrated with the control system to store information and enable learning.
        *   **Enhance Computation:** Replace the simple oscillator with more complex microfluidic logic (e.g., AND/OR/NAND gates, flip-flops) capable of processing sensor inputs and making decisions. Explore analog computation capabilities.
        *   **Enable Adaptation:** Design feedback mechanisms where sensor input, processed by the logic system and potentially stored in memory, modifies actuator behavior or controller parameters over time (e.g., adjusting oscillation frequency, changing gait).
        *   **Improve Energy Efficiency:** Investigate methods to reduce heat loss during reaction, minimize venting losses, or potentially harvest energy from environmental sources.
        *   **Quantify Robustness:** Systematically test and quantify the robot's robustness to variations in fabrication, environment (temperature, terrain), fuel quality, and external perturbations.
        *   **Explore Self-Organization in Function:** Move beyond self-organization in fabrication towards systems where functional behavior itself emerges dynamically and adaptively from local rules without a fully pre-determined central controller.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe specifically for "Sensing" (internal or external) distinct from computation or memory might be useful.
        *   Probe for quantifying the degree of "Autonomy" achieved (e.g., level of independence from external control/power/intervention).
        *   Probe for "Programmability" or "Tunability" of the behavior.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between "Self-Organization" (M4) and "Emergent Behavior" (M8) could be slightly clearer. M4 focuses on structure/pattern formation from local rules, while M8 focuses on the resulting functional behavior. This subtlety worked here but might be ambiguous in other contexts.
        *   The scope of "Embodied Computation" (M5) – does passive filtering count? The definition provided ("intrinsic to the material's physical properties") is good but examples are helpful.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on mapping *processes* (like auto-evacuation) vs. static components or dynamic states could be elaborated.
        *   Representing feedback loops within the GIN mapping needs clear conventions (e.g., specific edge types or attributes).
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Calculating the M13.1 Readiness Score required interpretation, especially when conditional modules are skipped or presence is binary/partial. Explicit rules for averaging (e.g., treating "No" or N/A as 0, "Partial" as 0.5, "Yes" as 1 in relevant boolean checks) would make it more consistent. *Self-correction: I initially struggled with this but revised based on the description.*
        *   M9.3 Cognitive Function Checklist scoring (0-10) relative to human-level is difficult and subjective for simple systems; anchoring examples might help.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Handling implicit vs. explicit was clear, but ensuring consistent justification levels required attention.
        *   Mapping qualitative assessments (Low/Medium/High) to eventual quantitative analysis in the GIN needs consideration.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very comprehensive and detailed, which is excellent for capturing nuanced information. Its length makes it demanding to complete fully. The conditional skipping logic is helpful. Strict adherence to formatting is critical but manageable.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Add explicit rules for calculating M13.1, including handling of conditional modules and presence scores (Yes/No/Partial).
        *   Consider adding a dedicated "Sensing" module.
        *   Provide more anchoring examples for scoring, especially in M9.3.
        *   Maybe combine M4 (Self-Organization) and M8 (Emergent Behavior) or clarify the distinction more sharply with examples. M4 could focus purely on structure/pattern genesis, M8 on the functional consequences.
