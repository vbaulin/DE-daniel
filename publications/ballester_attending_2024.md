__Paper Type:__ Theoretical/Computational

## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system is the Cellular Transformer (CT), a neural network architecture designed to generalize graph-based transformers to operate on cell complexes (topological spaces generalizing graphs, including nodes, edges, and faces). It processes data represented as 'cochains' (signals associated with cells of different ranks) defined on these complexes. Its core components include: (1) Transformer layers adapted for cell complexes, (2) Novel cellular attention mechanisms (pairwise and general) utilizing incidence relations between cells (e.g., node-edge, edge-face), and (3) Topological positional encodings (BSPe, RWPe, TopoSlepiansPE) designed specifically for cell complexes. The purpose is to improve the predictive performance of models on tasks involving topological data by effectively capturing higher-order relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in the cell complex structure, outperforming standard graph-based methods without needing enhancements like virtual nodes or graph rewiring. It takes an annotated cell complex as input and outputs predictions (e.g., classification, regression).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`="Algorithm/Neural Network", `domain`="Topological Deep Learning", `mechanism`="Attention (Cellular)", `components`=["Transformer Layers", "Cellular Attention", "Positional Encodings", "Cell Complexes", "Cochains", "Neighborhood Matrices"], `purpose`="Prediction on Topological Data"
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The abstract, introduction, and method sections (Sec 1, 3, 4) explicitly describe the CT architecture, its components, the type of data it processes (cell complexes, cochains), its attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and its purpose.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper provides a relatively clear description of the Cellular Transformer architecture, including the mathematical formulation of the proposed cellular attention mechanisms (Eq. 2), the structure of the transformer layers (Sec 4.1, Appendix A), the definition of cell complexes and cochains (Sec 3), and the different positional encoding methods (Sec 4.4, Appendix B, C). The use of tensor diagrams (Fig 2) aids understanding. Experimental setup (Sec 5, Appendix A, D, E) details hyperparameters, datasets, and training procedures. Some mathematical details (e.g., random walks on cell complexes, topological Slepians) are delegated to the Appendix or external references, slightly reducing full self-contained clarity, but the core implementation concept is well-described.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The core architecture and mechanisms are explicitly described with equations and text. However, full understanding requires referencing the Appendix and cited works for certain detailed mathematical underpinnings (e.g., Hodge Laplacians, Slepians). The score reflects the overall clarity achievable from the main text and appendices provided.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

        | :------------------------- | :---------: | :-----: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Transformer Layers (#Layers) | 12          | N/A     | Table 3 (Appendix A)      | Explicit          | High                            | N/A                               |

    *   **Note:** Values for Hidden Dimension and Attention Heads vary depending on the dataset (GCB/ogbg-molhiv/ZINC) as specified in Table 3. The maximum cell complex dimension considered is 2 (nodes, edges, faces), although the framework is claimed to be generalizable. Positional encoding type is a key selectable parameter.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: N/A. The paper describes a computational model. Energy input pertains to the computational resources (electricity) required to train and run the model on hardware (e.g., GPUs), which is not discussed in terms of physical energy flow within the conceptual system itself. Appendix E mentions hardware used (GPUs, CPU) but doesn't quantify energy input.
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Energy input is implicitly required for computation but not discussed or quantified within the paper's theoretical or experimental framework.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: N/A. The system is purely computational. There are no described physical energy transformations intrinsic to the Cellular Transformer model itself. Energy is consumed by the hardware executing the computations.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: The paper does not describe any physical energy transduction processes.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: N/A. Energy efficiency in a physical sense is not applicable. Computational efficiency (e.g., FLOPS, parameters, training time) is implicitly relevant but not framed as energy efficiency, nor is it explicitly quantified or compared in those terms against alternatives. The paper mentions computational limitations (quadratic complexity) in Sec 6.1, implying computational inefficiency for large inputs, but not thermodynamic efficiency.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
      *  Justification: The paper does not discuss or provide metrics for energy efficiency.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: N/A. As a computational model, energy dissipation occurs in the hardware (e.g., as heat from GPU/CPU) during execution, not as a defined mechanism within the model itself. Not discussed in the paper.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Energy dissipation is an implicit consequence of running the computation on physical hardware but is not a feature or mechanism described within the paper.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The template defines memory as "a change in system state that persists beyond stimulus, influencing future behavior" in the context of *material* intelligence. The Cellular Transformer is an algorithm; its "memory" consists of learned parameters (weights, biases, embeddings) stored digitally within the computational hardware after the training phase ("stimulus"). While these parameters persist and influence future predictions ("behavior"), this is *algorithmic* memory, not an intrinsic *physical material property* exhibiting memory as typically understood in cognizant matter (e.g., hysteresis, phase change memory, structural reconfiguration). The paper does not describe or claim any physical memory mechanism.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The paper describes a computational model with learnable parameters. The interpretation requires assessing whether this constitutes "memory" in the context of material intelligence, which it does not.

**(Conditional: M3.1 is "No", skipping M3.2-M3.8.)**

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: Self-organization refers to the spontaneous emergence of global order from local interactions without external control defining the *global structure*. The Cellular Transformer architecture is explicitly designed and defined (e.g., number of layers, heads, attention mechanisms). While the *data* it processes (cell complexes) has structure, and the *learned parameters* emerge from the local interactions during training (gradient descent based on local errors), the architecture itself does not spontaneously self-organize in a physical or structural sense as understood in material systems. The patterns learned are within the parameters, not the physical structure of the system.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper describes a predefined computational architecture. The absence of physical self-organization is inferred from the nature of the system described.

**(Conditional: M4.1 is "No", skipping M4.2-M4.7)**

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: Embodied computation is defined as computation intrinsic to the *material's physical properties*, not executed by an external controller. The Cellular Transformer is an algorithm executed *on* computational hardware (external controller/processor like GPU/CPU). The computation is not performed by the inherent physics of a material itself.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper describes an algorithm. The determination that this is not *embodied* computation in the material sense relies on the definition provided in the template.

**(Conditional: M5.1 is "No", skipping M5.2-5.4)**

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   **Vector ID:** M6
*   **Vector Type:** Temporal

### **6.1 Timescales:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.1
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value        | Units   | Source              | Implicit/Explicit | Justification                          |
        | :-------------------- | :----------: | :-----: | :-----------------: | :----------------: | :------------------------------------- |
        | Training Epochs (Max) | 350/200/10000| N/A     | Table 3 (App. A)    | Explicit          | Maximum number of passes through data. |
        | Warmup Epochs         | 35/20/1000   | N/A     | Table 3 (App. A)    | Explicit          | Initial phase of learning rate schedule. |
        | Inference Time        | N/A          | N/A     | Not mentioned       | N/A               | Time to make one prediction.           |
        | Attention Mechanism   | N/A          | N/A     | Section 4.2         | Implicit          | Computation time depends on complexity. |
    *   **Note:** Training and warmup epochs vary by dataset (GCB/ogbg-molhiv/ZINC). The paper mentions the quadratic complexity of attention (Sec 6.1), implying computation time scales with input size, but doesn't provide specific time values for inference or individual operations.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not mention or describe mechanisms related to active inference, such as prediction error minimization based on an internal world model driving action selection. The CT learns parameters via supervised learning (minimizing loss on training data), not by actively seeking information or minimizing surprise in an agentive sense.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The absence of active inference mechanisms is inferred from the description of the model's architecture, training process (supervised learning), and objectives.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: Adaptive plasticity refers to a system changing its *behavior or internal structure* due to experience, implying a physical change in the material system. The Cellular Transformer adapts its *behavior* (improves prediction accuracy) through *training*, which modifies its internal *parameters* (weights/biases stored digitally). This is algorithmic learning/parameter tuning, not a change in the physical structure or properties of a material system itself.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The paper describes algorithmic training. The interpretation that this is not adaptive *plasticity* in the material sense relies on the definition provided in the template.

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "No", skipping M7.2)**

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The primary functional behavior is performing predictions on datasets structured as cell complexes. Specifically, it performs graph classification (on GCB dataset, measured by accuracy) and molecular property prediction (on ZINC dataset, measured by Mean Absolute Error - MAE; on ogbg-molhiv dataset, measured by Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC-ROC). The system learns representations of cells (nodes, edges, faces) and uses the attention mechanism to aggregate information across the complex to make these predictions.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `BehaviorArchetypeNode`; Specify `type`="Classification" or `type`="Regression" based on task; Attributes: `metric` (Accuracy/MAE/AUC-ROC), `dataset` (GCB/ZINC/ogbg-molhiv).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: Section 5 (Experiments) and Tables 1 & 2 explicitly describe the tasks performed and the datasets/metrics used to evaluate the behavior.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The paper reports performance results often as mean ± standard deviation over multiple runs (e.g., GCB dataset, Table 1: 0.752±0.010 Accuracy), indicating some robustness to random initialization seeds. However, robustness to other perturbations (e.g., noise in input features, variations in cell complex structure, adversarial attacks, parameter variations) is not explicitly tested or discussed. The reported standard deviation for GCB is relatively small (0.010 / 0.752 ≈ 1.3%), suggesting reasonable stability for that specific task/dataset under repeated training runs. Results for ZINC and ogbg-molhiv are reported from single runs, limiting robustness assessment. The claim of achieving SOTA without enhancements like graph rewiring (Abstract, Sec 5.1) might imply some inherent robustness, but this is speculative without direct tests.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Standard deviations for GCB results are explicitly provided. Overall robustness to other factors is implicitly suggested but not directly measured or justified. The score reflects the limited explicit evidence available.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Reliability attribute of `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: The behavior (predictive performance) is validated through standard machine learning benchmark practices. This involves: (1) Using established public benchmark datasets (ZINC, ogbg-molhiv, GCB) with predefined train/validation/test splits (Sec 5). (2) Comparing performance against state-of-the-art baseline models (message passing networks, graph transformers, simplicial transformers) using standard metrics (Accuracy, MAE, AUC-ROC) (Table 1). (3) Reporting results on the held-out test set (Tables 1, 2, 4). (4) For GCB, reporting mean and standard deviation over multiple runs (5 random seeds) to assess stability (Sec 5). Limitations include single runs for ZINC/ogbg-molhiv due to computational constraints and the use of a potentially suboptimal graph lifting procedure (cycle filling) (Sec 5, 6.1). Claims of emergence in the complex systems sense are not made or validated.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: Section 5 and Appendix A explicitly detail the experimental setup, datasets, metrics, comparison methods, and reporting protocols used for validation.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: None. The paper does not attempt to map the Cellular Transformer's functionality to specific cognitive processes, even metaphorically. The discussion focuses on technical aspects like representation learning on topological spaces, attention mechanisms, and performance comparison with other machine learning models.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    * Justification: The absence of cognitive mapping is inferred from the content of the paper, which stays within the domain of machine learning and topological data analysis.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: Based on the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale: The Cellular Transformer performs pattern recognition and classification/regression tasks on complex structured data (Level 1/2). It learns representations and adapts its parameters through training (Level 2/3, algorithmically). However, it operates purely reactively based on its training. There is no evidence of goal-directed behavior based on internal models (Level 4+), context understanding beyond statistical correlations in the data (Level 5), abstract reasoning (Level 6), social interaction (Level 7), metacognition (Level 8), or consciousness (Level 9+). The score reflects capability slightly beyond simple fixed responsivity due to the learning aspect on complex topological data, but remaining far from higher cognitive functions and lacking any physical embodiment or autonomy as envisioned in cognizant matter.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is assigned based on comparing the described system's functionalities (learning, prediction on topological data) against the definitions provided in the Cognizance Scale.

### **9.3 Cognitive Function Checklist**

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not discuss or provide any evidence suggesting that the Cellular Transformer operates near a critical point, exhibits scale-free behavior, power laws, or long-range correlations in the sense typically associated with criticality in complex systems or physical phase transitions.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The absence of any discussion or data related to criticality is inferred from the paper's content.

## M11: Review Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   **Vector ID:** M11
*   **Vector Type:** Review
    *   Content: N/A (Paper is not a review)

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   **Vector ID:** M12
*   **Vector Type:** Theory

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper presents a clear theoretical framework for extending transformers to cell complexes. Key concepts like cell complexes, cochains, incidence matrices, and Hodge Laplacians are defined (or referenced clearly). The proposed cellular attention mechanisms and positional encodings are mathematically formulated (Sec 4, Appendix B, C). The relationship to existing work (graph transformers, TNNs) is discussed (Sec 2). Assumptions (e.g., working with 2-complexes for simplicity) are stated. The Appendix provides further mathematical details supporting the main text. The framework appears internally consistent and logically developed. Potential weakness might be the reliance on external references for some foundational topological concepts, slightly reducing self-contained rigor.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
       *  Justification: The core theoretical proposals are explicit. Full mathematical background relies partly on cited work (implicit within the paper itself).

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The proposed Cellular Transformer is an algorithm. Its realization potential refers to its implementability as software. The paper demonstrates this potential through experiments run on standard deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, PyG, DGL - mentioned in Appendix E) and hardware (GPUs). The architecture uses common building blocks (attention, MLPs, normalization) adapted for cell complexes. Data structures (sparse matrices for neighborhood info) and operations are feasible. The main barrier is computational cost for very large complexes (Sec 6.1), but the model itself is clearly realizable in software.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes experiments conducted using the implemented model (Sec 5, Appendix A, D, E), confirming its realization as software.

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework introduces novel ways to process data on higher-order topological structures (cell complexes), relevant for modeling complex systems where relationships go beyond pairwise interactions. This aligns with CT-GIN's interest in capturing system structure and function. The specific mechanisms (cellular attention, topological PEs) offer concrete computational tools. If *physical* systems can be effectively modeled as cell complexes with meaningful cochain data, the CT could potentially analyze or simulate aspects relevant to cognizant matter research (e.g., information flow in complex biological networks represented topologically). However, the model itself is purely computational and doesn't directly address core cognizant matter concepts like embodiment, physical memory, or energy flow. Its potential lies in analyzing *data derived from* such systems, rather than embodying intelligence itself.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: The score is based on assessing the relevance of the proposed computational framework (processing topological data) to the broader goals of modeling complex systems potentially exhibiting cognizance, as framed by CT-GIN.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: The Cellular Transformer (CT) presents a theoretically rigorous and well-implemented computational framework for extending attention-based neural networks to cell complexes, effectively processing data with higher-order topological structures. Its key strengths lie in the novel formulation of cellular attention and topological positional encodings, demonstrating strong empirical performance on relevant benchmark datasets compared to graph-based methods. However, from a *material intelligence* and CT-GIN perspective focusing on cognizant matter, the CT has significant limitations. It is a purely algorithmic system lacking physical embodiment, energy flow dynamics, physical memory mechanisms, self-organization, and adaptive plasticity in the material sense. Its "memory" and "adaptation" are confined to learned digital parameters during training. Consequently, its cognitive proximity score is very low. The CT's primary relevance to CT-GIN is as a potential tool for analyzing complex, topologically structured *data* that might be *derived from* physical cognizant systems, rather than being a model *of* or *for* cognizant matter itself. Its main contribution is advancing machine learning on topological domains.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Apply CT to Cognizant Matter Data:** Explore using CT to analyze datasets derived from simulations or experiments on actual or potential cognizant matter systems where higher-order topological relationships are hypothesized to be important (e.g., analyzing network motifs, information flow pathways, or structural changes in self-organizing systems represented as dynamic cell complexes).
        *   **Develop Dynamic CT Variants:** Extend the CT to handle dynamic cell complexes where the topology itself evolves over time, potentially modeling adaptive or developmental processes.
        *   **Integrate Physics-Informed Constraints:** Investigate incorporating physical laws or constraints (e.g., related to energy conservation, thermodynamics) into the CT architecture or loss function when applying it to physical system data.
        *   **Explore Hardware Embodiment (Speculative):** While the current CT is software, future research *could theoretically* explore physical implementations (e.g., neuromorphic hardware, optical computing) that might map parts of the CT's computational principles onto physical dynamics, potentially bridging the gap towards embodied computation, though this is far beyond the scope of the current paper.
        *   **Address Scalability:** Develop linearized or sparse versions of cellular attention to overcome the quadratic complexity limitations, enabling analysis of larger, more realistic systems.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:** The template is very comprehensive for *physical* cognizant matter. When analyzing purely *computational* models like this one, many sections become N/A. Consider adding conditional sections or specific probes tailored to assessing the *potential relevance* of computational models to cognizant matter research (e.g., "Potential Application to Cognizant System Data," "Analogies to Physical Processes Mentioned," "Scalability for Simulating Complex Systems"). Module 12 has steps in this direction for theoretical papers, but could be expanded or adapted for computational ones.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:** The distinction between algorithmic adaptation/memory/computation and their physical counterparts in cognizant matter is crucial but relies heavily on strict adherence to the provided definitions (which are clear). Perhaps add a reminder note at the start of relevant modules (M3, M5, M7) explicitly stating "Assess based on physical material properties, not purely algorithmic function unless explicitly mapped in the paper."
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:** Guidance was generally sufficient. For purely computational papers, explicitly stating that core CT-GIN nodes like `EnergyNode`, `MemoryNode` (physical), `SelfOrganizationNode` should *not* be created unless a physical mapping is described would be helpful. Suggesting alternative node types for algorithmic concepts (e.g., `AlgorithmNode`, `ParameterNode`, `LearnedRepresentationNode`) might be useful for building the KG for these paper types.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:** Assigning the Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) and Checklist (M9.3) for a non-embodied algorithm is inherently subjective. The scale is helpful, but comparing algorithmic pattern recognition to biological cognition across a single scale is challenging. Maybe refine the lower levels of the scale (0-3) with clearer descriptors for algorithmic capabilities vs. simple physical responses. Scoring robustness (M8.2) was difficult due to limited direct data in the paper; the template might prompt for specific types of robustness (noise, parameter variation, etc.) more explicitly.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:** Mapping was straightforward because the paper is well-structured. The main challenge was recognizing that most physical intelligence modules (M2, M3, M4, M7) were not applicable.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is highly detailed and usable for its intended purpose (analyzing papers on physical cognizant matter). Its application to purely computational papers reveals the significant conceptual gap between current ML models and embodied material intelligence, which is itself an insight. Adding guidance for handling computational papers more explicitly could improve usability for analyses like this one.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        1.  Add a top-level field: "Primary Domain: [Physical Material / Computational Model / Biological System / Hybrid / Theoretical Framework]".
        2.  In M3.1, M4.1, M5.1, M7.1 Justification prompts, add: "Justify based on physical mechanisms described. If only algorithmic parallels exist, answer 'No'."
        3.  Consider an optional module "M-Algo: Algorithmic Analogues" specifically for computational papers, to capture algorithmic memory, adaptation, computation details without conflating them with physical concepts in M3, M5, M7.
        4.  Refine M9.2/M9.3 scoring rubric for lower levels (0-3) to better differentiate simple reactive systems vs. sophisticated algorithmic pattern recognition/learning.
