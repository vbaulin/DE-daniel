## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   **Vector ID:** M1
*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system consists of N self-propelled active Brownian particles (ABPs), specifically termed intelligent ABPs (iABPs), simulated in two dimensions. Each iABP moves with a constant propulsion force/velocity and experiences translational and rotational diffusion. The key feature is self-steering based on two mechanisms: 1) Vision-based steering, where particles adjust orientation towards the center of mass of neighbors within a visual perception cone (VC), weighted by distance. 2) Polar alignment, where particles align their velocity vector with the average orientation of neighbors within a defined radius (PA). Excluded volume interactions are modeled via a Lennard-Jones potential. The purpose is to study the emergent collective behavior (structure formation, dynamics) resulting from the interplay between these steering mechanisms, particle activity (Pe), vision angle (θ), and maneuverabilities ((cid:2)v, (cid:2)a).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: Computational Model, `domain`: Active Matter Physics, `mechanism`: Agent-Based Simulation (iABPs), `components`: {Self-propelled particles, Vision-based steering interaction, Polar alignment interaction, Excluded volume interaction, Langevin dynamics}, `purpose`: Study emergent collective behavior (swarming, clustering, milling).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the model components (iABPs), their interactions (vision-based steering, polar alignment, LJ repulsion), the dynamics (Langevin equations), and the study's goal in the Abstract, Introduction, and Model sections.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the agent-based model, including the equations of motion for position (Eq. 1) and orientation (Eqs. 3, 8), the interaction potentials/torques (Eqs. 2, 4, 7), the definitions of the vision cone and alignment neighborhood (Fig. 1, Eqs. 5, 6), and the simulation parameters (Section III, Table I). The mathematical formulation is precise. Minor ambiguities might exist in the exact implementation details of averaging or numerical integration specifics not fully elaborated, but overall reproducibility is high.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The equations, parameters, and model setup are explicitly detailed in the text, figures, and tables.

### **1.3 Key Parameters**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.3
*   **Vector Type:** ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Péclet number (Pe) | 10 - 200 | dimensionless | Table I, Section III, Section IV | Explicit | High (Input Parameter) | N/A |

        | Visual maneuverability ((cid:2)v / DR) | 12.5 | dimensionless | Section III, Section IV | Explicit | High (Input Parameter) | N/A |
        | Alignment maneuverability ((cid:2)a / DR) | Varied (via (cid:2)a/(cid:2)v ratio 0.1 - 25) | dimensionless | Section II, Section IV (e.g., Fig 2 ratio) | Explicit | High (Input Parameter) | N/A |
        | Packing fraction (φ) | 7.85×10⁻³ | dimensionless | Section III, Section IV | Explicit | High (Input Parameter) | N/A |

    *   **Note:** These are key parameters varied or kept constant to study the system's behavior. DR is the rotational diffusion coefficient (DR = 8×10⁻²/τ).

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy input is the constant self-propulsion force applied to each iABP, represented as `γv₀eᵢ(t)` in Eq. 1, where `v₀` is the characteristic propulsion speed and `γ` is the friction coefficient. This force drives the particles' persistent motion against friction. This is implicitly analogous to chemical energy conversion in biological microswimmers or external power in robotic systems. Stochastic forces `Γᵢ(t)` also input thermal energy.
    *   Value: N/A (The force magnitude `γv₀` is related to Pe, but not explicitly given as a single value. Pe = σv₀/DT where DT = kBT/γ. So `γv₀ = Pe * kBT / σ`.)
    *   Units: N (Newtons)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Self-propulsion, `type`: Mechanical Force (implicit chemical/external source). `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: Thermal Bath, `type`: Stochastic Force.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Eq. 1 explicitly shows the `γv₀eᵢ` term. The interpretation as the primary energy input mechanism converting stored/environmental energy into motion is implicit based on the context of active matter. The stochastic force term is also explicit.

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: 1. Internal/Environmental Energy to Kinetic Energy: The propulsion force `γv₀eᵢ` performs work against the frictional drag `−γr˙ᵢ` and stochastic forces `Γᵢ`, maintaining the particle's directed kinetic energy. 2. Kinetic Energy to Potential Energy: During collisions, kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy via the Lennard-Jones repulsion (Eq. 2). 3. Information to Mechanical Torque: Information about neighbors' positions (via vision) and orientations (via alignment) is transduced into mechanical torques (Mvᵢ, Maᵢ, Eqs. 4, 7) that reorient the particle, influencing its kinetic energy direction. 4. Thermal Energy to Kinetic Energy: Stochastic forces `Γᵢ` and `Λᵢ` convert thermal energy into random translational and rotational kinetic energy.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Self-propulsion work against drag, `from_node`: EnergyInput_SelfPropulsion, `to_node`: KineticEnergy_Particle. `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Collision (LJ potential), `from_node`: KineticEnergy_Particle, `to_node`: PotentialEnergy_Interaction. `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Vision-based Steering, `from_node`: Information_NeighborPosition, `to_node`: RotationalEnergy_Particle. `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Polar Alignment, `from_node`: Information_NeighborOrientation, `to_node`: RotationalEnergy_Particle. `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: Thermal Fluctuation, `from_node`: EnergyInput_ThermalBath, `to_node`: KineticEnergy_Particle / RotationalEnergy_Particle.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The equations of motion (Eqs. 1, 3, 8) explicitly define the forces and torques involved. The interpretation of these terms as energy transduction pathways is implicit based on physical principles (work, potential energy, information processing leading to mechanical action).

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: The paper does not quantify the efficiency of energy conversion (e.g., from the implicit fuel source to directed motion or collective structures). As a model of active Brownian motion in a viscous environment, energy efficiency is expected to be very low due to continuous dissipation through friction, but no metrics are provided.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute of relevant `EnergyTransductionEdge`s (e.g., `efficiency`).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
      *  Justification: Efficiency is not discussed or quantified.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: Energy is primarily dissipated through: 1. Translational Friction: The term `-γr˙ᵢ` in Eq. 1 represents viscous drag, dissipating kinetic energy into the surrounding medium (heat). 2. Rotational Friction: Implicitly included, as rotational motion (ϕ˙ᵢ in Eq. 8) against the medium causes dissipation, related to the rotational diffusion coefficient DR. Thermal noise (Γᵢ, Λᵢ) represents coupling to a thermal bath, involving continuous energy exchange and dissipation consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Energy is also dissipated during inelastic aspects of collisions (though the LJ potential itself is conservative, the surrounding damping makes collisions dissipative overall). Quantification: The translational friction coefficient `γ` is given (relative to mass and thermal energy), but overall dissipation rates for the system or structures are not calculated. Dissipation is High due to the overdamped nature (m/γ = 10⁻²τ << τR).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode` (e.g., `MediumHeat`) and `EnergyDissipationEdge`s (e.g., from `KineticEnergy_Particle` via `TranslationalFriction`, from `RotationalEnergy_Particle` via `RotationalFriction`).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The friction term `-γr˙ᵢ` is explicit in Eq. 1. Rotational friction is implicit but standard in Langevin models involving DR. Quantification is largely absent, requiring inference (High dissipation in overdamped regime).

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The state of each particle (position `rᵢ` and orientation `eᵢ`) persists over time due to the continuous nature of the dynamics (Eqs. 1, 8). This state directly influences the particle's future state and, through the interaction terms (vision, alignment, repulsion), influences the future behavior of neighboring particles. This meets the definition of memory as a system state persisting beyond an instantaneous stimulus and influencing future behavior. However, this is physical state persistence (inertia in position/orientation space), not cognitive memory involving encoding, storage, and retrieval of specific past information to modify future computations or specific actions in a learned way.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The persistence of state is explicit in the differential equations governing the system. The interpretation of this persistence as 'memory' according to the template definition is explicit based on the definition provided, but the *lack* of higher-level cognitive memory is implicit (the model doesn't include mechanisms for storing discrete past events or learned associations).

**(Conditional: If M3.1 is "No", skip to Module 4. If "Yes", include M3.2 and M3.3.)**

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 1
*   Justification: The "memory" is simply the physical state persistence inherent in the continuous dynamics (positions and orientations). It has extremely short effective retention (related to relaxation times like τR = 1/DR), no distinct addressable states (capacity is related to the continuous state space), and no explicit read-out mechanism beyond physical interaction. It doesn't encode specific past events or learned rules. It corresponds only to the immediate physical history influencing the next infinitesimal time step. Score reflects minimal persistence beyond instantaneous reaction, lacking features of robust memory.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type (e.g., `PhysicalStatePersistence`).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    * Justification: The low score and justification are based on interpreting the system's physical persistence in the context of memory definitions, which is not explicitly discussed in these terms in the paper.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: ~1/DR for orientation; diffusion-dependent for position.
*    Units: τ (simulation time units)
*   Justification: The characteristic time for orientational decorrelation (loss of orientation 'memory') in ABPs is the rotational relaxation time, τR = 1/DR. Position 'memory' persists longer, related to the persistence length of the trajectory, influenced by Pe and interactions. DR = 8×10⁻²/τ, so τR = 12.5 τ. This is short-term physical persistence.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The retention time is not explicitly labeled as 'memory retention' but is derived from the standard physical parameters (DR) governing the system's relaxation dynamics, explicitly given in Section III.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute of the `MemoryNode` (e.g., `retentionTime`).

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: Memory is the continuous physical state (positions, orientations). There are no distinct, countable states in the sense of computational memory capacity.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
        *  Justification: The concept of discrete memory capacity is not applicable to this type of physical state persistence.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: N/A
*   Units: N/A
*   Justification: There is no explicit "readout" operation. The state influences future behavior through continuous physical interactions (forces, torques). The accuracy is limited by noise and interaction precision.
*    Implicit/Explicit: N/A
       *  Justification: The concept of readout accuracy is not applicable.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: ~DR for orientation; related to translational diffusion for position.
    *   Units: 1/τ
    *   Justification: State "degrades" or decorrelates due to rotational diffusion (rate DR) and translational diffusion/interactions.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
            * Justification: Derived from the physics of diffusion processes explicitly included in the model (DR, DT).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute of the `MemoryNode` (e.g., `decayRate`).

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper does not discuss memory operations or their energy costs. Maintaining the physical state requires continuous energy input to counteract dissipation, but this isn't framed as a memory operation cost.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table: N/A
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
*   Justification: Fidelity and robustness metrics for memory are not discussed.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly studies the "self-organized group formation and collective motion" (Introduction) and "emergent collective behavior" (Abstract). Global structures like swarms, clusters, and milling patterns emerge spontaneously from the local interaction rules (vision-based steering, alignment, repulsion) among the iABPs without any external template or global controller dictating the final structure. These structures are significantly larger than individual particles.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper's core focus and terminology directly address self-organization and emergent phenomena.

**(Conditional: If M4.1 is "No", skip to Module 5. If "Yes", include M4.2-M4.7)**

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content:
        1.  **Excluded Volume:** Particles interact via a short-range repulsive Lennard-Jones potential (Eq. 2), preventing overlap (`Fᵢ = -∂U/∂rᵢ`). Range `r ≤ 2^(1/6)σ`.
        2.  **Vision-Based Steering Torque (Mvᵢ):** Particles experience a torque directing them towards the weighted center of mass of neighbors `j` within their vision cone (VC) defined by angle `θ` and range `RV` (Eqs. 4, 6). Torque magnitude depends on visual maneuverability `(cid:2)v` and relative angle `φᵢⱼ - ϕᵢ`. Neighbors are weighted by `exp(-rᵢⱼ/R₀)`. See Eq. 8 for the 2D angular form: `((cid:2)v / Ncv,i) * Σ[j∈VC] exp(-rᵢⱼ/R₀) * sin(φᵢⱼ - ϕᵢ)`.
        3.  **Polar Alignment Torque (Maᵢ):** Particles experience a torque aligning their orientation `eᵢ` with the average orientation `eⱼ` of neighbors `j` within a distance `2Rc` (Eq. 7). Torque magnitude depends on alignment maneuverability `(cid:2)a` and relative angle `ϕⱼ - ϕᵢ`. See Eq. 8 for the 2D angular form: `((cid:2)a / Na,i) * Σ[j∈PA] sin(ϕⱼ - ϕᵢ)`.
        4.  **Self-Propulsion:** Constant force `γv₀eᵢ` along the current orientation `eᵢ` (Eq. 1).
        5.  **Stochastic Forces/Torques:** Gaussian white noise terms `Γᵢ(t)` (translational, Eq. 1) and `Λᵢ(t)` (rotational, Eq. 3, implicitly in Eq. 8 via `ξᵢ(t)`) representing thermal fluctuations.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `AdjunctionEdge` description (local side). Edges represent physical interactions: `LJRepulsionEdge`, `VisualSteeringEdge`, `PolarAlignmentEdge`. Attributes include parameters like `σ`, `ε`, `(cid:2)v`, `(cid:2)a`, `θ`, `R₀`, `RV`, `Rc`, `DΤ`, `DR`.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The interaction rules (forces and torques) are explicitly defined by mathematical equations (Eqs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8) and descriptions in the Model section.

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: Various globally ordered structures emerge depending on parameters:
        *   **Dispersed Clusters:** Small, transient groups of particles (Figs 2, 3, 4).
        *   **Close-Packed Clusters/Aggregates:** Dense, often quasi-circular, nearly immobile clusters (Figs 2, 4, 5). Sometimes hexagonally close-packed (HCP).
        *   **Wormlike Swarms:** Elongated, flexible, highly motile structures of aligned particles (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Thickness and length vary.
        *   **Milling:** Ring-like structures where particles circulate collectively (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 11). Can be bands or filled disks.
        *   **Dilute Phase:** Homogeneous, disordered state (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `ConfigurationalNode` types (e.g., `DilutePhase`, `Cluster`, `Swarm`, `MillingRing`). Attributes could include size, shape (asphericity), density, motility, polarization.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: These emergent structures are explicitly described, named, and shown in snapshots (Figs 2-6, 14) and phase diagrams (Figs 5, 12, 15, 16) throughout the Results section.

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper successfully constructs phase diagrams (Figs 5, 12, 15, 16) that map regions in parameter space (Pe, θ, (cid:2)a/(cid:2)v, R₀, Rc) to specific emergent global structures. This indicates a high degree of predictability – given a set of parameters, the resulting global order can be predicted with reasonable confidence based on the simulations. The existence of distinct phases and relatively sharp boundaries supports this. However, predictability isn't perfect; stochasticity means outcomes near phase boundaries or transient states can vary, and some structures (e.g., milling) might appear intermittently or depend subtly on initial conditions (mentioned for milling). Quantitative predictability metrics are not provided.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: The phase diagrams explicitly show the correlation between parameters and global order. The high degree of predictability is inferred from the consistency shown in these diagrams. Limitations due to stochasticity are partly explicit (discussion of milling stability) and partly implicit (inherent in stochastic simulations).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes to the `AdjunctionEdge` weight connecting local rules (`SystemNode`) to global states (`ConfigurationalNode`).

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | Local Rules -> Global State | Mapping from particle interaction rules (Eqs. 1-8) to emergent phases (swarms, clusters, etc.). | High (Score 8) | 7 | Phase Diagrams, Order Parameters (P, A, MSD slope) | Mixed | The local rules largely predict the global states seen in phase diagrams, but stochasticity and potential complex nonlinearities mean the mapping isn't perfect. Yoneda score reflects good but not total explanatory power. | Section IV.A, Figs 5, 12 |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** 7. Rubric: 0 = Local rules completely fail to predict global structure. 5 = Local rules predict general structure types but not boundaries or details well. 7 = Local rules predict phase diagram topology and structure types well, some boundary/stability details might differ slightly from simulation. 10 = Local rules perfectly predict all aspects of emergent global structures quantitatively. The model achieves good prediction of phase types and dependencies (e.g., Fig 5), justifying a score of 7.
    *   **Metrics:** Phase diagram topology matching, qualitative agreement of structure types, quantitative prediction of order parameters (A, P, ξp) based on local parameters (Pe, θ, (cid:2)a/(cid:2)v) via scaling relations (Figs 7 inset, 10, 11, 18 inset).
    *   **Justification:** The paper demonstrates that the defined local interaction rules (vision, alignment, repulsion, activity, noise) are sufficient to generate the rich variety of observed global phases. The construction of phase diagrams and scaling analyses (e.g., Fig 7 inset collapsing asphericity data) show a strong, predictable link between local parameters and global emergent order. The predictability score (M4.4) assesses *if* a state occurs, while the Yoneda score assesses how well the *local rules explain* the global state's existence and properties. The model explains the emergence well, but doesn't capture every nuance perfectly (e.g., precise stability of milling).

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The computation is intrinsic to the iABP's physical interactions. Each particle computes its change in orientation (and thus future velocity) based on the positions and orientations of neighbors detected through its 'visual' and 'alignment' sensors. These inputs are processed locally according to the rules defined by Eqs. 4, 7, and 8, resulting in output torques. This processing occurs within the particle simulation based on physical laws, not by an external controller dictating individual particle moves based on global information.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The processing of neighbor information via Eqs. 4, 7, 8 is explicit. Interpreting this rule-based physical interaction as 'embodied computation' according to the template definition is explicit based on the definition.

    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The inputs (positions, angles) and outputs (torques, orientation changes) are continuous (analog). The processing involves summing weighted influences according to specific rules (Eqs. 4, 7, 8), which could be considered a hybrid of analog signal processing and rule-based logic. The paper does not explicitly categorize the computation type.

### **5.3 Computational Primitive:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.3
*   **Vector Type:** Function
    *   Content: Weighted summation and nonlinear transformation (sine function) of neighbor inputs. Specifically:
        1.  For vision: Calculate weighted average direction to neighbors in VC (weighted by `exp(-rᵢⱼ/R₀)`), compute angle difference (`φᵢⱼ - ϕᵢ`), apply sine function, sum results, normalize (Eq. 8, first term).
        2.  For alignment: Calculate average orientation of neighbors in PA, compute angle difference (`ϕⱼ - ϕᵢ`), apply sine function, sum results, normalize (Eq. 8, second term).
        The primitive operation is the local integration of multiple neighbor signals (position and orientation) via trigonometric functions to determine a resulting torque/orientation change rate.
        *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** Vector Integration / Nonlinear Mapping
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode` (e.g., `function`: `NeighborSignalIntegration`).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The mathematical operations performed by each particle based on neighbor information are explicitly given in Eq. 8.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The model does not include mechanisms for active inference. Particles react to the *current* perceived state of their neighbors based on fixed rules (vision-based attraction, alignment). There is no evidence of: (1) an internal generative model predicting future states of neighbors or self, (2) comparison of prediction to perception to calculate prediction error/surprise, or (3) action selection aimed at minimizing this error or actively testing hypotheses about the environment. The behavior is reactive based on current sensory input, not predictive based on an internal model.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The absence of active inference mechanisms is inferred from the provided model equations and description, which lack the necessary components (internal models, prediction error calculation). The paper does not discuss active inference.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The system selects different stable collective states (swarms, clusters) depending on fixed parameters (Pe, θ, (cid:2)a/(cid:2)v), which could be seen as a form of adaptation *of the ensemble* to parameter conditions. However, the paper does not describe any *adaptive plasticity* where the particles' internal rules, parameters ((cid:2)v, (cid:2)a, θ), or interaction network change *over time* based on experience within a simulation run to improve performance (e.g., faster flocking, more stable swarms). The interaction rules and particle properties are fixed once parameters are set.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        * Justification: The model description lacks any mechanism for learning, rule modification, or structural change based on past performance or history within a simulation run. The observed changes are phase transitions due to parameter changes, not adaptive plasticity.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system exhibits several distinct collective behaviors emerging from local interactions:
        *   **Disordered Motion:** Particles move randomly with little correlation (Dilute Phase).
        *   **Clustering/Aggregation:** Particles form dense, relatively static clusters (Close-Packed Clusters).
        *   **Swarming/Flocking:** Particles form elongated, coherently moving groups (Wormlike Swarms) exhibiting persistent, superdiffusive motion over long timescales, interrupted by sharp turns.
        *   **Milling:** Particles form stable rotating ring-like structures.
        *   **Phase Separation:** Coexistence of dense clusters/swarms and a dilute gas phase.
        *   **Dynamic Splitting/Merging:** Large swarms can split, and smaller swarms can merge dynamically (mentioned for high Pe).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types (e.g., `DisorderedMotion`, `Aggregation`, `Swarming`, `Milling`, `PhaseSeparation`, `DynamicRearrangement`).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors are the main results, explicitly described, visualized (Figs 2-6), and characterized (Sections IV.A, IV.B, IV.C) in the paper.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The emergent behaviors (phases) are shown to be robust within specific regions of the parameter space (Pe, θ, (cid:2)a/(cid:2)v), as demonstrated by the phase diagrams (Figs 5, 12). This indicates robustness to the inherent stochasticity (noise) within those parameter regimes. However, the system is sensitive to parameter values, with transitions occurring as parameters change (e.g., Fig 7 shows sharp change in asphericity). Robustness to particle number variations is explored (finite-size effects, Section IV.D, Fig 12), showing overall similar topology but shifted boundaries, indicating moderate robustness. Robustness to imperfections (e.g., heterogeneity in particle properties) or external perturbations is not explicitly tested. Some states like milling are noted to be potentially metastable or intermittent (Section IV.A.1).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Phase diagrams explicitly show stability regions. Sensitivity to parameters is explicit in the phase transitions. Finite-size effect discussion explicitly addresses N. Robustness to other factors (heterogeneity, external perturbations) is implicitly untested. Metastability of milling is explicitly mentioned.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: This score contributes to the reliability attributes of the `BehaviorArchetypeNode`.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Claims of emergent behaviors are validated through:
        *   **Agent-Based Simulations:** The behaviors are directly observed in numerical simulations of the model (Section III).
        *   **Visualizations:** Snapshots provide qualitative evidence of the structures (Figs 2, 3, 4, 6, 14). Movies are referenced [58].
        *   **Quantitative Analysis:** Order parameters (Polarization P, Asphericity A, Radius of Gyration Rg) are calculated to characterize the structures (Section IV.B, Figs 7, 8, 18). Dynamical properties (MSD, persistence length ξp, milling frequency ω, milling radius R) are measured to quantify behavior (Section IV.C, Figs 9, 10, 11, 20, 21).
        *   **Phase Diagrams:** Systematic exploration of parameter space maps regions where specific behaviors are stably observed (Section IV.A, Figs 5, 12, 15, 16).
        *   **Scaling Analysis:** Relationships between parameters and behavioral metrics are investigated (e.g., A vs (cid:2)a/((cid:2)vθν), ξp vs θ, R/ω vs Pe/N) to reveal underlying principles (Sections IV.B.2, IV.C.2, IV.C.3).
        *   **Control/Comparison:** Implicit comparison to limiting cases (e.g., vision-only, alignment-only/Vicsek) is discussed (Introduction, Section IV.A).
        *Limitations: Validation relies solely on simulations of the proposed model. Experimental validation is suggested via analogies (animal swarms, microbots) but not performed. Robustness tests are limited (mainly N, parameters).
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly details the simulation methods, visualizations, quantitative metrics, phase diagrams, and scaling analyses used to support the claims about emergent behaviors.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The paper uses terms like "intelligent ABPs (iABPs)" and "visual perception" which are analogies to biological cognition. The visual perception mechanism (sensing neighbors in a cone, steering towards center of mass) is directly inspired by animal vision and flocking/schooling behavior (Introduction references [8, 10, 16, 17, 34-37]). The alignment mechanism is analogous to velocity matching rules in animal groups (ref [16, 19]). The discussion explicitly compares the emergent structures (swarms, milling) to those observed in animal groups (fish, birds, ants, worms) and suggests the model offers insights into animal behavior and design criteria for microbots (Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion). However, the mapping is largely analogical; the paper doesn't claim the particles possess genuine cognitive states like beliefs or goals.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` from `BehaviorArchetypeNode` (e.g., `Swarming`, `Milling`) and `SystemNode` attributes (e.g., `visualPerception`, `alignment`) to `CognitiveFunctionNode` (e.g., `CollectiveMotion`, `SocialInteraction`, `Perception`).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly uses cognitive terms ("intelligent", "perception"), draws analogies to animal behavior throughout, and discusses implications for understanding biological systems.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: The system exhibits complex collective behaviors emerging from local interactions involving sensing (visual perception analogy) and response (steering, alignment). This aligns with Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity) - behavior shows basic adaptation *of the collective* to parameters and exhibits coordinated action, but lacks individual learning, internal models, complex representation, or goal-directedness beyond the implicit goal of cohesion/alignment encoded in the rules. The particles are reactive agents following simple rules based on immediate perception. There's no evidence for planning, model-based reasoning, or self-awareness (Levels 4+). The 'intelligence' is limited to the information processing capacity required for the steering/alignment rules.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: The score is based on interpreting the system's demonstrated capabilities (reactive sensing, rule following, emergence of collective states) against the provided CT-GIN Cognizance Scale. The paper provides the evidence for the system's behavior, but the placement on the scale is an assessment.

    *   **Note:** Scores reflect the absence of higher cognitive functions as typically understood. The system excels at generating complex *collective* behavior from *simple* individual rules.

## M10: Criticality Assessment
*   **Vector ID:** M10
*   **Vector Type:** Criticality

### **10.1 Criticality:**

*   **Vector ID:** M10.1
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear
    *   Justification: The paper studies phase transitions between different collective states (e.g., disordered to swarm/cluster, swarm to milling), which often occur at critical points in parameter space. The Introduction mentions the Vicsek model's phase transition [19, 21] and compares the authors' model mechanisms. The identification of phase boundaries in the constructed phase diagrams (Figs 5, 12, 15, 16) implicitly relates to critical phenomena. However, the paper does not explicitly analyze markers of criticality, such as scale-free correlations, power-law distributions of cluster sizes or avalanche dynamics, or susceptibility peaks near the identified transitions. While the system exhibits transitions reminiscent of critical phenomena, specific analysis *of* criticality (beyond identifying phase boundaries) is absent.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): Potentially Pe, θ, (cid:2)a/(cid:2)v values at the phase boundaries.
        *   Evidence: Phase diagrams (Figs 5, 12, 15, 16) show boundaries between distinct collective states. Discussion compares to Vicsek model criticality (Introduction, Sec IV.B.3). Lack of explicit criticality analysis (power laws, correlations) prevents a definitive "Yes".
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *    Justification: The existence of phase transitions is explicit. The potential link to criticality is implicit/analogous to similar systems (like Vicsek). The lack of specific analysis *of* criticality markers is implicit based on absence.

## M11: Review Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   **Vector ID:** M11
*   **Vector Type:** Review
    *   Content: N/A (Paper type is Theoretical/Computational)

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   **Vector ID:** M12
*   **Vector Type:** Theory

### **12.1 Theoretical Rigor:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.1
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 9
    *   Justification: The theoretical framework (agent-based model) is well-defined with clear mathematical descriptions of particle dynamics (Langevin equations) and interaction rules (LJ, vision torque, alignment torque) - Eqs 1-8. Assumptions (e.g., constant speed, overdamped dynamics, specific forms of interactions) are clearly stated or standard in the field. The model builds upon established active matter frameworks (ABP, Vicsek). Derivations (e.g., Eq. 8 from 4 & 7 in 2D, Eq. 10 mean-field estimate) appear sound. The computational implementation uses standard algorithms (Velocity Verlet suitable for stochastic systems - Sec III). Overall, the model is presented with high theoretical and computational rigor.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: The model equations, parameters, and simulation methods are explicitly detailed.

### **12.2 Realization Potential:**

*   **Vector ID:** M12.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly suggests potential physical realizations: "active colloids, which are steered externally by a laser beam, with an input signal mimicking visual perception [51–53]" (Sec II) and providing "design criteria for swarming microbots" (Abstract, Sec V). Implementing combined visual perception (requiring potentially complex sensing and processing) and velocity alignment in synthetic micro-scale systems is challenging but feasible with current/developing technology in active colloids and microrobotics. Achieving the exact interaction forms and parameter control might be difficult, but the general principles are realizable.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: Potential realization in active colloids and microbots is explicitly mentioned. The assessment of feasibility (challenging but plausible) is inferred based on the state of the art in those fields, which is not detailed in the paper itself.

### **12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score**

* **Vector ID:** M12.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The model provides a clear link between local rules (interactions, M4.2) and emergent global behaviors (M4.3, M8.1). Its components (particles, interactions) and states (phases) can be readily mapped to nodes and edges in a CT-GIN framework. The model explores the interplay of different interaction types (vision vs. alignment) and their effect on collective states, which is relevant for understanding how combinations of simple mechanisms generate complex behavior (a key aspect of CT-GIN analysis). The parameters ((cid:2)v, (cid:2)a, θ, Pe) act as control knobs tuning the emergent behavior, allowing for systematic study of the structure-function relationship. The system clearly demonstrates self-organization (M4) and embodied computation (M5), relevant modules in the CT-GIN template. While lacking higher cognitive features (memory, learning), it serves as an excellent base system for studying emergence from local rules, making it highly suitable for CT-GIN analysis and potential extension.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: The score is based on assessing the model's features (clear local-global link, tunable parameters, embodied computation, self-organization) against the goals and structure of the CT-GIN framework, which is an interpretation not explicitly stated in the paper.

        *   Average: (9 + 0 + 1 + 8 + 6 + 2) / 6 = 26 / 6 = 4.33 (CORRECTION: Need to use all applicable scores from M1-4, M8.2, M9.2).
        *   Let's reassess which scores apply: M1.2 (Clarity), M2.3 (Efficiency - N/A=0), M3.2 (Memory Type - Low=1), M4.4 (Predictability), M4.7 (Yoneda), M5.1 (Computation Presence - Yes,implicit score needed, let's use 7 based on justification), M8.2 (Robustness), M9.2 (Cognitive Proximity).
        *   Applicable Scores: M1.2=9, M2.3=0, M3.2=1, M4.4=8, M4.7=7, M5.1=7 (inferred score reflecting presence and clarity), M8.2=6, M9.2=2.
        *   Average: (9 + 0 + 1 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 2) / 8 = 40 / 8 = 5.0.
        *   Let's re-read the instruction: "Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2". Scores are: M1.2=9, M2.3=0, M3.2=1, M4.4=8, M8.2=6, M9.2=2. Total available scores = 6.
        *   Average = (9 + 0 + 1 + 8 + 6 + 2) / 6 = 26 / 6 = 4.33. Okay, using the specified scores. Maybe M4.7 should be included under M4? The instruction is specific. Let's use 4.33.

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a computationally rigorous model of self-steering active particles (iABPs) demonstrating complex emergent collective behaviors (swarming, clustering, milling) governed by the interplay of local vision-based steering and polar alignment rules. Its key strength lies in clearly demonstrating self-organization (M4) and embodied computation (M5) where local interactions lead to predictable global states, mapped effectively via phase diagrams. The model captures phenomena analogous to biological collective motion, giving it some cognitive proximity (M9, Score 2). However, its limitations within the CT-GIN framework are significant. It lacks genuine adaptive plasticity (M7) and higher cognitive functions like long-term memory (M3, Score 1) and planning/goal-direction beyond the implicit rules. Energy flow (M2) is implicit and efficiency is unquantified. While demonstrating complex dynamics across multiple timescales (M6), it doesn't exhibit active inference. Overall, the system represents a strong example of emergent complexity from simple rules (Level 2 Cognizance), providing a solid foundation for CT-GIN analysis focused on self-organization and embodied computation, but significant extensions would be needed to approach higher levels of material intelligence involving learning, memory, and adaptation.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Introduce Adaptive Plasticity:** Modify the model so particles can adapt their parameters (e.g., (cid:2)v, (cid:2)a, θ) based on local experience (e.g., local density, neighbor alignment success) to achieve more efficient swarming or navigation.
        *   **Implement Memory:** Incorporate internal state variables that store information about past interactions or environmental features over longer timescales than physical persistence, influencing future steering decisions.
        *   **Quantify Energy & Efficiency:** Analyze the energy input required to sustain different collective states and the efficiency of converting input energy into coherent motion or structure formation. Map energy dissipation landscape.
        *   **Explore Active Inference:** Develop an internal model within particles to predict neighbor behavior or environmental features, and modify steering rules to minimize prediction error.
        *   **Enhance Robustness Analysis:** Systematically test the robustness of emergent phases to particle heterogeneity (e.g., variations in v₀, (cid:2)v, (cid:2)a), external perturbations, and different noise models.
        *   **Bridge to Experiment:** Collaborate on experimental realizations using steered colloids or microbots to validate simulation predictions and refine model parameters based on physical constraints.
        *   **Deeper Criticality Analysis:** Investigate critical exponents, correlation functions, and fluctuation dynamics near the identified phase transitions.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   A probe explicitly asking for the *control parameters* varied in the study and their ranges would be useful under M1. (M1.3 captures some, but a dedicated probe might be clearer).
        *   A probe on the specific *nature of noise* (e.g., multiplicative/additive, correlations) could be added under M1 or M4.
        *   For theoretical papers, a probe about comparison to analytical predictions or mean-field theories could be useful (partly covered by M12.1, but could be more specific).
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The distinction between M4.4 (Predictability) and M4.7 (Yoneda Score) could be clearer. Predictability seems to ask *if* the global state is predictable, while Yoneda asks *how well* the stated local rules explain the global state. This distinction is subtle and might need refinement or illustrative examples in the rubric.
        *   The scope of "memory" (M3) vs. physical state persistence needs careful handling. While the current definition allows classifying state persistence as memory, it might be useful to have sub-categories or scoring guidance distinguishing physical persistence from learned/encoded memory to better align with cognitive concepts. The current low score partly addresses this.
        *   The definition of "Embodied Computation" (M5.1) is good, but the types (M5.2) and primitives (M5.3) could benefit from more examples relevant to physical systems (e.g., pattern matching, gradient following, physical reservoir computing).
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance on representing *parameters* (like Pe, θ) in the graph could be more explicit (e.g., attributes of SystemNode, control parameters influencing edges?).
        *   How to represent *phase transitions* between ConfigurationalNodes? Suggesting `StateTransitionEdge`s with conditions (parameter thresholds) might be helpful.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Assigning the Yoneda score (M4.7) required significant interpretation of the concept in the context of the paper. A more detailed rubric with examples for different system types would be beneficial.
        *   Assigning the Cognitive Proximity score (M9.2) and checklist scores (M9.3) involves judgment. The scale is helpful, but concrete examples tied to scores would improve consistency.
        *   Calculating the CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) - the instruction specified averaging specific scores, but it wasn't immediately clear if *all* applicable scores should be used or only the listed ones. Clarifying the exact calculation basis is needed. (I followed the specific list.)
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Mapping simulation parameters (often given in relative/dimensionless units) to absolute physical values (for energy, time) can be difficult if base units aren't consistently defined or used. The template asks for units, which is good.
        *   Distinguishing between explicitly stated values and implicitly derived ones requires careful reading and justification.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very comprehensive but long. For complex papers, filling it requires significant time and careful cross-referencing. The conditional sections work well. The strict formatting is crucial but demanding. Grouping optional/detailed subsections (like M3.4-M3.8) might improve readability for core analysis.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Add a field under M1 for "Control Parameters and Ranges".
        *   Refine M4.7 rubric with examples.
        *   Consider sub-typing M3 memory or refining scoring guidance.
        *   Clarify the exact scores included in the M13.1 calculation.
        *   Provide more GIN mapping examples, especially for parameters and transitions.
