__Paper Type:__ Theoretical/Computational

## M1: System Overview & Implementation
*   Vector ID: M1
*   Vector Type: Overview

### 1.1 System Description

*   Vector ID: M1.1
*   Vector Type: Description
    *   Content: The system is an agent-based model simulating a bidisperse collective of agents moving in opposing desired directions (+x and -x) within a 2D domain with periodic boundaries in x and walls in y. The agents' motion is governed by a social force model. Each agent possesses a 'memory' mechanism, modeled as an integrated deviation of its velocity from its desired velocity over time. This memory influences the agent's dynamics through an additional force term, attempting to compensate for past non-optimal movement. The components are agents (two types with opposing goals), the 2D environment (periodic in x, bounded in y), and the interaction forces (restitution, memory, inter-agent repulsion, agent-wall repulsion). The purpose is to investigate how agent-level memory (representing a facet of intelligence) affects the emergent collective dynamics, specifically focusing on jamming and lane formation phenomena in crowded systems like pedestrian crossings or lane-less traffic.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: AgentBasedModel, `domain`: CollectiveMotion/CrowdDynamics, `mechanism`: SocialForceModel_with_Memory, `components`: [`AgentType1`, `AgentType2`, `Environment2D`, `RestitutionForce`, `MemoryForce`, `RepulsiveForce`], `purpose`: StudyEffectOfMemoryOnCollectiveDynamics
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the agent types, environment, governing equations (Eq 1-5), memory model (Eq 2), forces, and the study's objective in Sections I and II.

### 1.2 Implementation Clarity

*   Vector ID: M1.2
*   Vector Type: Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The model equations (1-5) are clearly presented. The parameters (`α`, `β`, `γ`, `l_cr`, desired velocity `v_0`, number of agents) are defined. The simulation setup (bidisperse crowd, initial conditions, domain boundaries) is described. The analysis metrics (time of crossing `t_c`, vertical displacement `d_v`, jamming order parameter `J`, symmetry order parameter) are defined. Some details could be clearer, such as the exact numerical integration method used or the specific perturbation applied to initial positions, but the core model is well-described and reproducible in principle.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The score justification is based on the explicit presentation of model equations, parameters, setup, and metrics in Sections II and III.

### 1.3 Key Parameters

*   Vector ID: M1.3
*   Vector Type: ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |
        | :------------- | :---: | :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
        | Memory timescale (`α`) | Varied (e.g., 0.3, 5, 10, 21) | Time units (scaled by `τ_0`) | Section II, Figs 1C, 1D, 2B, 2C, 3, 4, 5 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Memory force strength (`β`) | Varied (e.g., 4) | Dimensionless (scaled) | Section II, Figs 1C, 1D, 2B, 2C, 3, 5 | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Number of Agents | 40 (20 per group) | Count | Section II.B | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Desired Speed (`s_0` or `||v_0||`) | Scaled to 1 | Speed units (scaled) | Section II (Eq 3 and surrounding text) | Explicit | High | N/A |
        | Repulsion cutoff (`l_cr`) | N/A (Value not specified) | Length units | Section II (Eq 4, 5) | Explicit (Existence), Implicit (Value) | Low | N/A |

    *   Note: Units are scaled/dimensionless as described in Section II. Reliability is high for explicitly stated simulation parameters within the context of the model. `l_cr` value is not given, only its existence and role.

## M2: Energy Flow
*   Vector ID: M2
*   Vector Type: Energy

### 2.1 Energy Input

*   Vector ID: M2.1
*   Vector Type: Input
    *   Content: The concept of energy input in a physical sense is not explicitly modeled. The driving force originates from the agents' desire to reach `v_0,i` (restitution term) and the memory term `βM_i`, which represent internal goals/drives rather than external energy sources. Computationally, energy is consumed to run the simulation.
    *   Value: N/A
    *   Units: N/A
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: InternalAgentGoal/Memory, `type`: ComputationalImplicit
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper models forces and velocities, not explicit energy sources. The driving terms are internal to the agent's behavioral rules.

### 2.2 Energy Transduction

*   Vector ID: M2.2
*   Vector Type: Transduction
    *   Content: Not explicitly modeled in terms of physical energy. Implicitly, the "potential energy" associated with deviation from desired velocity (`v_0,i - v_i`) and memory state (`M_i`) is transduced into kinetic energy changes via the restitution and memory forces. Kinetic energy is also modified by repulsive interactions (inter-agent and wall). These are computational transformations within the simulation dynamics.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: ForceToDoWork (Implicit), `from_node`: AgentInternalState, `to_node`: AgentKineticState
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Energy transduction is not discussed. It can only be inferred from the physics analogy of forces doing work to change velocity (kinetic energy).

### 2.3 Energy Efficiency

*   Vector ID: M2.3
*   Vector Type: Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: Physical energy efficiency is not defined or measured in this computational model. One could consider "goal achievement efficiency" (how quickly agents reach their destination or maintain desired velocity), which is indirectly measured by the jamming parameter `J`, but this is not energy efficiency.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
      *  Justification: The paper does not discuss energy efficiency.

### 2.4 Energy Dissipation

*   Vector ID: M2.4
*   Vector Type: Dissipation
    *   Content: Not explicitly modeled as physical energy dissipation. Repulsive collisions implicitly represent inelastic interactions where kinetic energy is not conserved perfectly, analogous to dissipation. The model lacks explicit friction or viscous damping terms beyond the restitution term's effect (which drives towards `v_0,i`, not necessarily zero). Memory decay (`-M_i/α`) could be seen as a form of "information dissipation". Computationally, energy is dissipated as heat by the computing hardware. Assessment: Medium (implicit in collisions).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyDissipationNode` attributes - `mechanism`: InelasticCollisions (Implicit), ComputationalHeat. `EnergyDissipationEdge` links `AgentKineticState` to `DissipationNode`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: Dissipative mechanisms like friction are not explicitly included (except implicitly in collisions). The discussion focuses on dynamics, not energy balance.

## M3: Memory
*   Vector ID: M3
*   Vector Type: Memory

### 3.1 Memory Presence:

*   Vector ID: M3.1
*   Vector Type: Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system explicitly models memory (`M_i`) for each agent. This memory term is defined as the time integral of the deviation of the agent's actual velocity (`v_i`) from its desired velocity (`v_0,i`) (Eq 2). This stored information about past velocity deviations persists beyond the instantaneous stimuli (current velocity and neighbor positions) and influences future behavior through the memory force (`βM_i`) added to the equation of motion (Eq 1), causing the agent to compensate for past suboptimal movement.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: The memory mechanism (`M_i`), its update rule (Eq 2), and its effect on dynamics (Eq 1) are explicitly defined and central to the paper.

*(Conditional: M3.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M3.2-M3.8)*

### 3.2 Memory Type:

*   Vector ID: M3.2
*   Vector Type: Score
*   Score: 6
*   Justification: The memory is a continuous, dynamical variable representing an integrated history of velocity deviations. It's continuously updated (written), decays over time (`α`), and influences dynamics (readout via force). It has a variable retention time (`α`) and its capacity is related to the magnitude of integrated past velocity deviations. It's not simple bistability but a dynamic trace. It allows agents to "make up for their non-optimal past". It resembles integral control in control theory. It lacks discrete states or complex encoding but captures a persistent influence of history. Retention: Tunable (`α`). Capacity: Continuous, related to velocity history magnitude. Readout accuracy: Directly proportional contribution to force (`βM_i`). Re-writable: Continuously updated. Stability: Decays unless reinforced by ongoing velocity deviations.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `MemoryNode` type attributes: `type`: IntegratedVelocityDeviation, `mechanism`: DifferentialEquation (Eq 2), `encoding`: ContinuousVector (`M_i` is 2D).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The mechanism and characteristics of the memory `M_i` are explicitly defined by Eq 1 and 2 and the surrounding text (Sections I, II). The score is an interpretation based on these explicit descriptions.

### 3.3 Memory Retention Time:

*   Vector ID: M3.3
*   Vector Type: Parameter
*   Value: `α` (Varied parameter, e.g., 0.3, 5, 10, 21)
*    Units: Time units (scaled by `τ_0`)
*   Justification: `α` is explicitly defined in Eq 2 as the timescale corresponding to how far back the agent remembers, governing the decay rate of the memory state `M_i`.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        * Justification: `α` is explicitly defined as the memory timescale in Section II.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Key attribute `retention_timescale` of the `MemoryNode`.

### 3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)

* Vector ID: M3.4
* Vector Type: Parameter
*  Value: N/A (Potentially unbounded in principle)
*   Units: Integrated velocity units (scaled)
*   Justification: The model (Eq 2) does not impose an explicit bound on the magnitude of `M_i`. In practice, the dynamics (restitution, collisions) likely limit the extent of velocity deviations, indirectly limiting `M_i`. The capacity isn't defined in terms of discrete states or bits, but rather the magnitude of the accumulated deviation vector the system can represent. Assessment: High (Theoretically unbounded, practically limited by dynamics).
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper does not discuss memory capacity. The potential boundlessness is inferred from the form of Eq 2. Practical limits are implied by the system dynamics.

### 3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)

* Vector ID: M3.5
* Vector Type: Parameter
*   Value: 100% (within the model)
*   Units: %
*   Justification: The memory state `M_i` directly and deterministically contributes to the force on the agent via `βM_i` in Eq 1. There is no noise or error specified in this readout process within the model's definition.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
       *  Justification: The paper doesn't use the term "readout accuracy", but the deterministic relationship between `M_i` and the memory force in Eq 1 implies perfect readout within the model's formulation.

### 3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)
* Vector ID: M3.6
* Vector Type: Parameter
    *   Value: `1/α`
    *   Units: Inverse time units (scaled by 1/`τ_0`)
    *   Justification: Eq 2 explicitly includes the decay term `-M_i/α`, indicating an exponential decay of the memory state with a rate constant of `1/α`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
            * Justification: The decay term `-M_i/α` is explicit in Eq 2.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `decay_rate` (= 1 / `retention_timescale`) of the `MemoryNode`.

### 3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)
* Vector ID: M3.7
* Vector Type: Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | Write (Update M_i)  | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | N/A               | N/A               | Energy cost is not modeled. Computation involves updating M_i based on Eq 2. |
    | Read (Apply Force)  | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | N/A               | N/A               | Energy cost is not modeled. Computation involves calculating `βM_i` for Eq 1. |
    | Decay               | N/A                          | N/A                             | N/A   | N/A               | N/A               | N/A               | Energy cost is not modeled. Computation involves the `-M_i/α` term. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper does not model or discuss the energy costs associated with memory operations.

### 3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)
* Vector ID: M3.8
* Vector Type: Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | Fidelity  | Accuracy of representing past velocity deviation integral | N/A (Assumed perfect within model) | N/A | Attribute of `MemoryNode` | Model Definition | Implicit | Model equations are deterministic; no noise modelled in memory process. |
    | Robustness| Sensitivity to noise or perturbations | N/A | N/A | Attribute of `MemoryNode` | N/A | N/A | Robustness of the memory mechanism itself is not tested or discussed. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: N/A
*   Justification: Fidelity and robustness metrics for the memory itself are not explicitly defined or evaluated. Fidelity is implicitly perfect in the deterministic model.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   Vector ID: M4
*   Vector Type: Self-Organization

### 4.1 Self-Organization Presence:

*   Vector ID: M4.1
*   Vector Type: Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly studies and observes emergent group-level phenomena like the formation of jammed configurations (including symmetric interlocks) and lanes. These global patterns arise spontaneously from the local interactions (restitution, memory, repulsion forces) between agents, without external control dictating the final configuration. The transition between jammed and laned states based on memory parameters (`α`, `β`) is a key emergent behavior studied. The paper contrasts this with agent-level rules, stating "the features of the emergent behaviour are not explicitly encoded in the rules at the level of the agent" (Section I).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper repeatedly discusses emergent phenomena (jamming, laning, symmetric interlocks) arising from local agent interactions (e.g., Sections I, III.B, IV).

*(Conditional: M4.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M4.2-M4.7)*

### 4.2 Local Interaction Rules:

*   Vector ID: M4.2
*   Vector Type: Rules
    *   Content: The local interaction rules are defined by the equations of motion for each agent `i`:
        1.  **Velocity Update (Eq 1):** `d v_i / dt = (v_0,i - v_i) + β M_i + Σ_{j≠i} F_ij + F_i,w`
            *   `v_0,i - v_i`: Restitution force (tries to restore desired velocity). `v_0,i` depends only on agent type.
            *   `β M_i`: Memory force (compensates for past deviations, depends on agent's own history `M_i`).
            *   `Σ_{j≠i} F_ij`: Sum of repulsive forces from neighboring agents `j` within distance `l_cr` (Eq 4). Depends on relative positions `d_ij`.
            *   `F_i,w`: Repulsive force from walls (Eq 5). Depends on agent's y-position relative to walls.
        2.  **Memory Update (Eq 2):** `d M_i / dt = - M_i / α + (v_0,i - v_i)`
            *   Depends only on the agent's own current deviation `v_0,i - v_i` and its own current memory state `M_i`.
        3.  **Repulsive Force (Agent-Agent, Eq 4):** `F_ij = -γ(d_ij - 2)^-3 * d̂_ij` if `d_ij < l_cr`, 0 otherwise. Depends on distance `d_ij` between agent `i` and `j`. `γ` is force strength. (Note: Paper has `(d_ij - 2)^-3` which might be a typo, often it's related to overlap distance, e.g., `(l_cr - d_ij)`). Assuming radii are 1, `d_ij-2` could represent overlap if `d_ij` is center-to-center distance. Let's assume the formula is as written.
        4.  **Repulsive Force (Agent-Wall, Eq 5):** `F_iw = -γ(||wall - y_i|| - 1)^-3 * d̂_ij` if `d_iw < l_cr`, 0 otherwise. Assumes wall interaction is similar, `d̂_ij` likely typo for `ŷ`. Depends on distance to wall.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `AdjunctionEdge` attributes (local side): `rule_type`: DifferentialEquation, `equations`: [Eq1, Eq2, Eq4, Eq5], `dependencies`: [`AgentState_i`, `AgentState_j` for j in Neighbors(i), `MemoryState_i`, `WallPositions`]. These define the "LocalInteraction" category of edges.
    * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The interaction rules are explicitly given as mathematical equations (Eq 1-5) in Section II.

### 4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:

* Vector ID: M4.2.1
* Vector Type: Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------ | :---------- | :------------- | :-------------------- | :---: | :----------: | :----------------: | :------------: |
    | Eq 1, 2 | Memory effect | `α` | e.g., 0.3 to >20 | Scaled Time | Section II, Figs 1-5 | Explicit | Memory timescale parameter. |
    | Eq 1 | Memory effect | `β` | e.g., 4 | Dimensionless | Section II, Figs 1-5 | Explicit | Memory force strength parameter. |
    | Eq 4, 5 | Repulsion | `γ` | N/A (Value not specified) | Scaled Force * Length^4 | Section II | Explicit (Existence) | Repulsive force strength parameter. |
    | Eq 4, 5 | Repulsion | `l_cr` | N/A (Value not specified) | Scaled Length | Section II | Explicit (Existence) | Repulsion cutoff distance. |
    | Eq 1, 2 | Restitution | `τ_0` (Implicit scale=1) | N/A (Scaled to 1) | Scaled Time | Section II | Implicit | Inertia/restitution timescale used for scaling. |
    | Eq 1, 3 | Driving | `v_0` | +e_x or -e_x (Magnitude 1) | Scaled Velocity | Section II | Explicit | Desired velocity vector. |

### 4.3 Global Order:

*   Vector ID: M4.3
*   Vector Type: Order
    *   Content: The global order that emerges includes:
        1.  **Temporary Jammed Configurations:** Agents meet near the center and form a compact, slow-moving or stationary arrangement.
        2.  **Symmetric Interlocks:** A specific type of jammed state observed with short-term memory, characterized by an equal number of agents from each group in each 'lane' or layer within the jam (Fig 3A).
        3.  **Asymmetric Jammed Configurations:** Jammed states lacking the symmetry mentioned above, observed with very low memory (Fig 3A).
        4.  **Laned Configuration:** Agents segregate into distinct lanes based on their desired direction of motion, allowing for freer movement past the initial interaction zone. This is more prominent with long-term memory.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `ConfigurationalNode` types: `Jamming`, `SymmetricInterlock`, `AsymmetricJam`, `Laning`. Attributes could include `order_parameter_J`, `symmetry_parameter`.
    * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: These global states (jammed, symmetric interlocks, laned) are explicitly described and analyzed, particularly in Sections II.B, III.B, and visualized schematically (Figs 2A, 3A).

### 4.4 Predictability of Global Order:

*   Vector ID: M4.4
*   Vector Type: Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper demonstrates that the type of global order (jammed vs. laned, symmetric vs. asymmetric jam) is largely predictable based on the memory parameters (`α`, `β`). Figure 2C shows a heatmap of the jamming order parameter `J` as a function of `α` and `β`, indicating distinct regimes. Figure 3 relates symmetry to `α`. The emergence of specific states (symmetric interlocks for short-term memory, efficient laning for long-term memory) is presented as a reliable outcome for given parameter ranges. However, the exact microscopic configuration for a single run depends on initial conditions, introducing stochasticity (mentioned implicitly by using different "realisations" in Fig 3B/C). Predictability is high at the level of macroscopic state/order parameter for given (`α`, `β`), but low for exact microscopic configuration.
    * Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The predictability of macroscopic states based on parameters (`α`, `β`) is explicitly shown (Figs 2C, 3B/C). The influence of initial conditions implies microscopic unpredictability, which is implicit.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Contributes to `AdjunctionEdge` weights linking `AgentStateNode` (via local rules) to `ConfigurationalNode`. High score suggests strong correlation.

### 4.5. Local Interaction Rules (for Self-Organization)
* Vector ID: M4.5
* Vector Type: Table
*   Table:
| Rule ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
| Eq 1,2  | Memory Dynamics | `α`       | 0.3 - 21+   | Scaled time | Explicit | Parameter controlling memory timescale, influencing rearrangements and symmetry. | Sec II, Figs 1-5 |
| Eq 1    | Memory Force    | `β`       | e.g., 4     | Dimensionless | Explicit | Parameter controlling memory strength, influencing dynamics. | Sec II, Figs 1-5 |
| Eq 4,5  | Repulsion       | `γ`, `l_cr`| N/A        | Scaled Force*Length^4, Scaled Length | Explicit (existence) | Parameters controlling steric interactions, crucial for jamming/laning. | Sec II |

### 4.6. Globally Emergent Order and Order Parameters
* Vector ID: M4.6
* Vector Type: Table
*   Table:
| Property ID | Description | Parameter | Value Range | Units | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Protocol | Source |
| :---------- | :---------- | :-------- | :---------- | :---: | :----------------: | :------------: | :------: | :-----: |
| Jamming | Probability of finding a slowly moving agent (<0.15 * desired speed) | Jamming Order Parameter (`J`) | ~0.05 - 0.4+ | Dimensionless | Explicit | Quantifies the degree of collective slowdown/jamming. | Calculated from agent speed histograms over time. | Sec III.B, Fig 2B, 2C |
| Symmetry | Fraction of layers in jammed config. with equal numbers from each group | Symmetry Order Parameter | ~0 - 1 | Dimensionless | Explicit | Quantifies the symmetry of the jammed structure. | Measured from snapshots of jammed configurations. | Sec III.B.1, Fig 3B, 3C |
| Laning | Implicitly measured by low `J` | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Efficient laning corresponds to low jamming (`J`). | N/A | Sec III.B, Fig 2C |
| Heterogeneity | Standard deviation of speeds in local neighborhood | Speed SD | Varied (Boxplot range) | Scaled Velocity | Explicit | Quantifies local variation in agent movement, linked to efficient unjamming/laning. | Calculated from agent speeds in local neighborhood (radius 3*agent radius). | Sec III.B.2, Fig 5 |

### 4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity

*   Vector ID: M4.7
*   Vector Type: Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | Local Rules -> Global Order | Mapping from agent interactions (Eq 1-5) & memory params (`α`,`β`) to emergent states (Jamming `J`, Symmetry) | High (for macro state) | N/A | `J(α,β)`, `Symmetry(α)`, Speed SD(`α`) | Mixed | The paper establishes correlation but doesn't frame it via Yoneda. | Figs 2C, 3B, 3C, 5 |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** Order parameters `J` and Symmetry; Standard Deviation of local speeds.
    *   **Justification:** The paper explores the relationship between local parameters/rules (`α`, `β`, forces) and global emergent order (`J`, Symmetry, Laning, Heterogeneity). This constitutes exploring the local-to-global mapping. However, the formalism of Yoneda embedding is not used or mentioned, so a score cannot be assigned based on the paper's content. The predictability is high for the macroscopic state given the parameters, as shown by the consistent relationships found.

## M5: Computation
*   Vector ID: M5
*   Vector Type: Computation

### 5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:

*   Vector ID: M5.1
*   Vector Type: Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: Agents perform computation embodied in their physical dynamics. They integrate information from their environment (neighbors via `F_ij`, walls via `F_iw`), their internal goal (`v_0,i`), and their past experience (memory `M_i`) to compute their next state (velocity `v_i` update via Eq 1, memory `M_i` update via Eq 2). This computation is intrinsic to the agent's rules and simulated physical interactions, not performed by an external controller guiding individual agent decisions based on global state.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper doesn't explicitly frame agent behavior as "computation". However, the processing of local information and memory according to defined rules (Eq 1, 2) to determine future state fits the definition of embodied computation.

*(Conditional: M5.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M5.2-5.4)*

### 5.2 Computation Type:

*   Vector ID: M5.2
*   Vector Type: Classification
    *   Content: Analog/Hybrid
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the `ComputationNode` type: AnalogHybrid.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *    Justification: The state variables (position, velocity, memory `M_i`) are continuous (analog). The rules involve continuous functions and differential equations. The agent types (+/- desired velocity) represent a discrete element. The update process occurs in discrete time steps in the simulation, but models continuous time dynamics.

### 5.3 Computational Primitive:

*   Vector ID: M5.3
*   Vector Type: Function
    *   Content: The most basic computational operation is the update step governed by Eq 1 and 2. This involves:
        1.  Sensing: Determining neighbor positions (`d_ij`) and wall distances (`d_iw`).
        2.  Integration: Accumulating velocity deviation into memory `M_i` (Eq 2, essentially time integration).
        3.  Weighted Summation/Force Calculation: Combining restitution force, memory force, and repulsive forces according to Eq 1.
        4.  State Update: Updating velocity based on the net force (numerical integration of Eq 1) and updating memory based on deviation and decay (numerical integration of Eq 2).
        This can be viewed as a form of reactive control computation with memory (similar to Proportional-Integral control, as mentioned in Section I and IV).
    *   **Sub-Type (if applicable):** Reactive Control Update / PI-like Control Step.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines the primary function of the `ComputationNode` as `StateUpdate_via_LocalRules`. Attributes could include `integrative_memory`, `force_summation`.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The equations (Eq 1, 2) explicitly define the update steps. Interpreting this as computation or a specific control type (PI) is partly explicit (Section I mentions PI controller analogy) and partly implicit categorization.

## M6: Temporal Dynamics
*   Vector ID: M6
*   Vector Type: Temporal

### 6.1 Timescales:

*   Vector ID: M6.1
*   Vector Type: ParameterTable
    *   Table:
        | Timescale Description | Value | Units | Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
        | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------------: | :------------: |

### 6.2 Active Inference:

*   Vector ID: M6.2
*   Vector Type: Assessment
    *   Content: Partial
    *   Justification: The agents act to minimize the deviation between their current velocity (`v_i`) and their desired velocity (`v_0,i`). This implicitly involves a prediction: the desired state (`v_0,i`) acts as a prediction of the ideal future state. Actions (accelerating/decelerating/turning due to forces including memory) are taken to reduce the "error" (`v_0,i - v_i`). The memory term `M_i` allows the agent to account for *past* errors, improving its error correction - akin to an integral term in control, which can be related to simple forms of prediction error minimization over time. However, the system lacks explicit prediction of *future environmental states* (e.g., predicting other agents' moves) or complex internal models of the world beyond achieving the desired velocity vector.
        1.  *Prediction:* Implicit prediction of achieving `v_0,i`.
        2.  *Action Selection:* Forces in Eq 1 drive action to reduce deviation `(v_0,i - v_i)`.
        3.  *Internal Models:* Simple internal goal (`v_0,i`) and memory (`M_i`) representing integrated past deviations.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The mechanism of minimizing deviation from `v_0,i` using forces including memory is explicit (Eq 1, 2). The interpretation in the context of Active Inference (prediction error minimization, internal models) is implicit/inferred.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:**
        *   Prediction Error Rate: Average magnitude of `||v_0,i - v_i||` over time, potentially weighted by `1/α`. Lower values might indicate more effective "inference".
        *   Anticipation Timescale: Not directly applicable as agents don't predict future environmental states.
        *   Model Complexity: Low, characterized by `v_0,i` and the memory integration timescale `α`.
        *   Quantify reduction in deviation achieved by memory term: Compare dynamics with `β=0` vs `β>0`. Metrics like average speed closer to `||v_0,i||` or reduced time spent moving away from `v_0,i` direction.

## M7: Adaptation
*   Vector ID: M7
*   Vector Type: Adaptation

### 7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:

*   Vector ID: M7.1
*   Vector Type: Binary
    *   Content: Yes (at collective level), Partial (at individual level)
    *   Justification: The *collective behavior* adapts significantly based on the memory parameters (`α`, `β`), shifting between inefficient jamming and efficient laning (Fig 2C). This demonstrates plasticity in the group's emergent dynamics. At the *individual agent level*, the internal state (`M_i`) changes persistently based on experience (velocity history), influencing future actions. This fits the definition. However, the *rules* governing the agent (Eq 1-5) do not change; only the state `M_i` adapts. The adaptation leads to altered functionality/performance (unjamming time, efficient movement via lanes).
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The change in collective behavior with memory parameters is explicitly shown. The adaptation of individual agent state `M_i` is explicit via Eq 2. Characterizing this as "adaptive plasticity" is an interpretation.

*(Conditional: M7.1 is "Yes", proceeding with M7.2)*

### 7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:

*   Vector ID: M7.2
*   Vector Type: Description
    *   Content: The mechanism for individual agent adaptation is the continuous update of the memory state `M_i` according to Eq 2: `d M_i / dt = - M_i / α + (v_0,i - v_i)`. The memory state `M_i` integrates the history of velocity deviations (`v_0,i - v_i`), weighted by the retention timescale `α`. This change is driven by the agent's own experience (its deviation from the goal) and internal dynamics (decay term). This stored historical information then modifies the agent's force calculation via `βM_i` in Eq 1, altering its subsequent motion. This resembles a form of internal state adaptation based on performance error feedback (deviation from `v_0,i`). It's analogous to integral control adaptation.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `AdaptationNode` type linked to `AgentNode`. `mechanism`: InternalStateUpdate (IntegralErrorFeedback), `equation`: Eq2. Could define `Monad` edges representing the agent state update loop involving memory.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The update rule (Eq 2) and its influence (Eq 1) are explicit. The categorization as "adaptation mechanism" and analogy to error feedback/integral control is explicit in the text (Sections I, IV discuss PI control analogy and making up for past).

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   Vector ID: M8
*   Vector Type: Behavior

### 8.1 Behavior Description:

*   Vector ID: M8.1
*   Vector Type: Description
    *   Content:
        1.  **Collective Motion:** Agents move towards opposing desired directions.
        2.  **Collision/Interaction:** Agents exert repulsive forces on each other and walls upon proximity.
        3.  **Jamming:** Formation of dense, slow-moving or static configurations where agents hinder each other's movement towards their goal. Specific types include symmetric and asymmetric jams.
        4.  **Unjamming:** Spontaneous resolution of jammed states.
        5.  **Laning:** Spontaneous segregation of agents into parallel streams based on their desired direction, facilitating smoother flow.
        6.  **Sliding:** Individual agents maneuvering past each other, involving temporary vertical displacement.
        7.  **History Compensation:** Individual agents exerting additional force based on past velocity deviations (via memory).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` types: `CollectiveMotion`, `Collision`, `Jamming` (subtypes `SymmetricJam`, `AsymmetricJam`), `Unjamming`, `Laning`, `Sliding`, `HistoryCompensation`.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors are explicitly described, analyzed, and often named throughout the paper, particularly in Sections I, II.B, III, and IV.

### 8.2 Behavior Robustness:

*   Vector ID: M8.2
*   Vector Type: Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The emergence of specific collective behaviors (jamming types, laning) appears robust within certain parameter regimes (`α`, `β`), as shown by the phase plot (Fig 2C) and consistent observations across realisations (Fig 3C suggests trends hold despite variation). Symmetric jams are noted as being harder to unjam, suggesting they are robust/stable states under short-term memory conditions. Laning appears robust for long-term memory. Robustness to noise in initial conditions or agent parameters is not explicitly tested, but the use of multiple realisations suggests some robustness. The system relies on specific interaction rules; significant changes might alter behavior qualitatively.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly notes symmetric jams take longer to unjam (implying robustness). The phase plot (Fig 2C) explicitly shows distinct behavioral regimes based on parameters. Robustness to other perturbations (noise, parameter variation beyond `α`, `β`) is implicit or not addressed.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Score contributes to reliability attributes of `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s (Jamming, Laning).

### 8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation

*    Vector ID: M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Claims of emergent behaviors are validated through:
        1.  **Simulation:** Direct numerical simulation of the agent-based model (Eq 1-5).
        2.  **Qualitative Observation:** Descriptions of simulation dynamics (e.g., agents meet, form jams, unjam, form lanes - Sec II.B, III.B).
        3.  **Quantitative Analysis:**
            *   Order Parameters: Jamming order parameter `J` (Fig 2B, 2C) quantifies jamming. Symmetry order parameter (Fig 3B, 3C) quantifies jam structure.
            *   Metrics for Pair Dynamics: Time of crossing `t_c` and vertical displacement `d_v` for two agents (Fig 1C, 1D).
            *   Statistical Distributions: Speed histograms (Fig 2B), standard deviation of local speeds (Fig 5).
        4.  **Parameter Space Exploration:** Systematically varying `α` and `β` to map out different behavioral regimes (Fig 1C, 1D, 2C).
        5.  **Mechanism Analysis:** Explanations linking local dynamics (sliding time, hole formation, boundary effects, heterogeneity) to global outcomes (jamming, symmetry, laning - Sec III.B.1, III.B.2).
        *   Limitations: Validation relies solely on simulation within the defined model. No comparison with real-world experimental data is presented. Robustness tests are limited primarily to varying `α` and `β` and using different initial conditions.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The methods used (simulation, order parameters, metrics, parameter sweeps, qualitative descriptions) are explicitly described in Sections II and III.

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   Vector ID: M9
*   Vector Type: Cognition

### 9.1 Cognitive Mapping:

*   Vector ID: M9.1
*   Vector Type: Description
    *   Content: Yes, the paper explicitly maps the 'memory' mechanism (`M_i`) to a facet of agent 'intelligence' or 'cognition'. It frames the central question around how interactions between "intelligent agents" translate to collective outcomes (Abstract, Sec I). Memory is described as originating from "cognitive faculties intrinsic to the 'intelligent' agent" (Sec II). The study aims to see if this "intelligence" (memory) leads to "intelligent" collective states (efficient movement). The PI controller analogy also links the mechanism to engineered intelligent systems. Limitations: 'Intelligence' is reduced to only this specific memory mechanism. The mapping is primarily an analogy to motivate the model.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `CognitiveMappingEdge` linking `MemoryNode` / `HistoryCompensation` (Behavior) to `CognitiveFunctionNode` (Memory/Intelligence).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper explicitly uses terms like "intelligent agents", "cognitive faculties", "intelligence" when referring to the agents and their memory mechanism (Abstract, Sec I, Sec II).

### 9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:

*   Vector ID: M9.2
*   Vector Type: Score
    *   Score: 2
    *   Justification: Based on the CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:
        *   Level 0/1: System goes beyond simple reactivity due to memory.
        *   Level 2 (Sub-Organismal Responsivity): Fits best. The system exhibits adaptation of internal state (`M_i`) based on past experience (velocity deviation), influencing future behavior. This memory component allows for behavior modification beyond immediate stimulus-response.
        *   Level 3 (Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy): Partial fit. Agents adapt state `M_i`, influencing behavior, but the *rules* are fixed, and the behavioral repertoire (move according to forces) is limited. It lacks significant autonomy in goal selection or rule changes.
        *   Higher Levels: Not applicable. No evidence of complex internal models, planning, relational reasoning, symbolic manipulation, social understanding beyond repulsion/alignment tendencies, or self-awareness. The "intelligence" is a very specific, low-level mechanism (integrated error signal).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The score is based on evaluating the explicitly described system features (memory mechanism, agent rules) against the provided scale (which is external to the paper).

*   Vector Type: Criticality

### 10.1 Criticality:

*   Vector ID: M10.1
*   Vector Type: Assessment
    *   Content: Unclear
    *   Justification: The paper does not explicitly discuss or test for criticality (e.g., scale-free behavior, power laws, long-range correlations) in the context of phase transitions or optimal information processing. While the system shows transitions between collective states (jammed vs. laned) as parameters (`α`, `β`) are varied (Fig 2C), these transitions are not analyzed through the lens of critical phenomena.
        *   Critical Parameters (If Yes/Partial): N/A
        *   Evidence: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: N/A

## M12: Theoretical Paper Specifics (Conditional)

*   Vector ID: M12
*   Vector Type: Theory

### 12.1 Theoretical Rigor:

*   Vector ID: M12.1
*   Vector Type: Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The theoretical model (social force model with memory) is clearly defined with mathematical equations (Eq 1-5). Assumptions (e.g., form of forces, memory mechanism) are stated. The model builds upon established frameworks (social force models). The derivation of the memory model is not detailed in this excerpt but alluded to connection with control theory. The variables and parameters are well-defined. The analysis seems logically consistent within the model's framework. Potential minor ambiguity or typo in Eq 4/5 noted earlier.
       * Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: Assessment based on the explicit presentation and definition of the model in Section II.

### 12.2 Realization Potential:

*   Vector ID: M12.2
*   Vector Type: Score
    *   Score: 6
    *   Justification: The model is abstract (point agents, scaled units). However, it's inspired by and aims to provide insights into real-world systems like pedestrian crowds and lane-less traffic (Sec I, IV). Social force models are commonly used for these systems. Implementing the specific 'memory' mechanism (integral of velocity deviation affecting force) in physical agents (robots) or accurately mapping it to human cognitive processes driving behavior in crowds would be challenging but conceptually plausible. It requires agents capable of tracking their velocity relative to a goal and integrating this deviation over time to modulate their propulsion. Realizing the exact force laws might also be difficult.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *  Justification: The connection to real systems is explicit. The assessment of feasibility involves interpreting the model's requirements and implicitly judging the difficulty of implementing them physically or biologically.

### 12.3 Potential for Future CT-GIN Implementation Score

* Vector ID: M12.3
*   Vector Type: Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The paper provides a clear example of incorporating a simple memory mechanism (M3) into agents and studying its effect on emergent self-organization (M4) and collective behavior (M8). It explores temporal dynamics (M6) related to memory (`α`). It touches upon adaptation (M7) via internal state changes and connects to cognition (M9) by framing memory as intelligence. The model is well-defined, facilitating mapping to CT-GIN components (Agents, Memory, Interactions, Behaviors). It highlights non-trivial relationships between local rules (memory parameters) and global outcomes, which is central to CT-GIN analysis. It offers a concrete system for studying how a basic cognitive capacity (memory) influences collective intelligence, providing a good basis for CT-GIN modeling and comparison with other systems. Potential is high for analyzing local-to-global mappings.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    *   Justification: Based on evaluating the explicitly presented model and results against the implicit goals and structure of the CT-GIN framework.

## M13: Overall Assessment & Scoring

*   Vector ID: M13
*   Vector Type: Overall

### 13.1 CT-GIN Readiness Score:

*   Vector ID: M13.1
*   Vector Type: Score
*   **Calculated Score:** 5.17 (Average of M1.2=8, M2.3=0 (N/A), M3.2=6, M4.4=7, M8.2=6, M9.2=2. Scores M2.3=N/A counts as 0. Calculation: (8+0+6+7+6+2)/6 = 29/6 = 4.83. Re-check formula: Modules 1-4, M8.2, M9.2. M1=M1.2=8. M2=? Use M2.1/2/3/4? M2.3 is N/A=0. M3=M3.2=6. M4=M4.4=7. M8.2=6. M9.2=2. Score = (8+0+6+7+6+2)/6 = 4.83. Let's re-read "Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2". Maybe it means average of *all numeric scores* within those modules? M1.2=8. M2.3=N/A. M3.2=6. M4.4=7. M8.2=6. M9.2=2. Cognitive Checklist average=2.75. It's unclear how to average across modules with different numbers of scores. Let's stick to the explicit list: M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2. Score = 4.83). Let me recalculate assuming N/A = 0 in the numerator but doesn't count in the denominator if the entire module concept isn't applicable well (like energy). But the template says "scores with N/A convert in 0". Okay, interpretation is (8 + 0 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 2) / 6 = 4.83.

### 13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   Vector ID: M13.2
*   Vector Type: Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a theoretical/computational model of collective motion where agent-level memory, representing a basic facet of intelligence, significantly influences emergent self-organization. Key strengths from a CT-GIN perspective include the explicit modeling of memory (M3) with a tunable timescale (`α`), the clear demonstration of emergent global orders (jamming, laning - M4) arising from well-defined local rules (M4.2), and the investigation of temporal dynamics related to memory (M6). The study explicitly links local parameters (`α`, `β`) to global behavior (`J`, Symmetry), providing a good basis for analyzing local-to-global mappings. Key limitations include the absence of energy flow analysis (M2), limited exploration of embodied computation metrics (M5), adaptation being restricted to internal states rather than rules (M7), and a low cognitive proximity score (M9) due to the simplicity of the "intelligence" modeled. The system's robustness and scalability are only partially explored. Overall, the paper provides a valuable minimal model for studying the interplay of memory and collective behavior, offering good readiness for CT-GIN analysis focused on memory, self-organization, and temporal dynamics, but lacks depth in energy, computation, complex adaptation, and higher cognition aspects.

### 13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   Vector ID: M13.3
*   Vector Type: Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Energy Modeling:** Incorporate a notion of energy cost for agent movement and memory operations to assess efficiency trade-offs.
        *   **Computational Analysis:** Quantify the computational cost (e.g., operations per time step) associated with the memory mechanism and agent updates.
        *   **Richer Cognition:** Explore more complex memory models (e.g., associative, context-dependent) or add other cognitive faculties like prediction or attention.
        *   **Adaptive Rules:** Implement mechanisms for agents to adapt their interaction rules (e.g., change `β` or `α` based on local congestion or success rate) rather than just their memory state.
        *   **Robustness Testing:** Systematically evaluate the robustness of emergent behaviors to noise (e.g., in sensing, actuation, or memory) and variations in other system parameters (`γ`, `l_cr`).
        *   **Scalability Analysis:** Investigate how the observed phenomena (jamming thresholds, laning efficiency) scale with the number of agents (N).
        *   **Criticality Analysis:** Analyze the transitions between jammed and laned states for signatures of critical phenomena.
        *   **Active Inference Formalism:** Frame the agent behavior more formally within the Active Inference framework, quantifying free energy minimization or prediction error dynamics.

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   Vector ID: M16
*   Vector Type: Feedback

### Template Feedback:

*    Vector ID: M16.1
*   Vector Type: Text
Provide specific, actionable feedback on the *CT-GIN template itself*, based on this analysis:
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   **Energy for Computational Models:** Module 2 (Energy Flow) is difficult to apply directly to purely computational/theoretical models where physical energy isn't the primary focus. Consider adding guidance or alternative probes for assessing computational energy/resource cost, or defining 'energy' more abstractly (e.g., information cost, goal achievement potential).
        *   **Details of Emergence:** While M4 covers self-organization, perhaps add probes specifically about the *process* of emergence (e.g., critical fluctuations, symmetry breaking mechanisms identified, time course of pattern formation).
        *   **Control Theory Mapping:** Given the paper explicitly mentions control theory (PI controller), a probe comparing the system to standard control architectures could be useful, especially for systems exhibiting feedback and goal-directedness.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   **CT-GIN Readiness Score Calculation (M13.1):** The instruction "Average of scores from Modules 1-4, M8.2 and M9.2" is ambiguous. Does it mean average *only* the listed scores (M1.2, M2.3, M3.2, M4.4, M8.2, M9.2)? Or average all numeric scores *within* those modules? Clarification is needed on how N/A scores are handled in the average (count as 0 in numerator and denominator, or exclude from denominator?). The current interpretation used was (M1.2 + (M2.3 or 0) + M3.2 + M4.4 + M8.2 + M9.2) / 6.
        *   **Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2):** The Cognizance Scale is helpful but applying it consistently requires careful judgment. Providing more concrete examples for each level, especially in the context of material/agent systems, would improve scoring reliability.
        *   **Yoneda Embedding (M4.7):** This concept might be too advanced or specific for many papers in this domain. Its relevance and application need clearer justification or it could perhaps be optional/conditional based on whether the paper uses category theory concepts.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:**
        *   Guidance is generally good, but more examples for complex relationships (like feedback loops involving multiple node types, or emergence) could be beneficial.
        *   Distinguishing between `AdjunctionEdge` (local-to-global structure) and other edges representing dynamic influence could be clearer.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Assigning scores for qualitative aspects (like Implementation Clarity, Predictability, Robustness) can be subjective. More detailed rubrics or anchoring examples for different score levels might help consistency.
        *   M9.3 (Cognitive Function Checklist) requires scoring multiple diverse functions, potentially leading to variability.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:**
        *   Handling N/A values and justifying them requires careful attention.
        *   Mapping computational model parameters (which might be scaled/dimensionless) to physical units can be tricky if scaling factors aren't explicit. The template handles units well, but this is a common challenge.
        *   The strict formatting requirement (no bold in headings/probes per instructions vs. template visual) caused initial confusion. Explicitly stating whether list item labels (`*   **Vector ID:**`) should be bold or not would remove ambiguity. I opted for no bold based on the strict interpretation of the instructions over the visual template.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very comprehensive and detailed, which is good for capturing rich information. However, its length and complexity make it time-consuming to apply. Some optional sections (like M3.4-M3.8) are well-indicated. Perhaps M4.7 could also be optional. Conditional logic based on paper type is good.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Clarify the CT-GIN Readiness Score calculation.
        *   Provide more examples/guidance for applying the Cognizance Scale and Yoneda Embedding.
        *   Add guidance on handling energy/computation for non-physical models.
        *   Resolve the ambiguity regarding bold formatting in list item labels vs. headings.
        *   Consider adding a probe on Control Theory analogies if relevant.
