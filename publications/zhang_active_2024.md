*   **Vector Type:** Overview

### **1.1 System Description**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The system is an active machine learning framework for simulating the dynamic growth of carbon nanostructures on metal surfaces. It combines Molecular Dynamics (MD) and time-stamped force-biased Monte Carlo (tfMC) simulations with a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) machine learning potential (termed CGM-MLP) trained on-the-fly using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The components include: the GAP model, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors for structure selection, DFT (CP2K) for generating training data (energies, forces), MD/tfMC simulation engine (LAMMPS with QUIP), and an active learning loop that selects new structures for DFT calculation based on similarity metrics (Dave, Dmax). The purpose is to accurately and efficiently simulate the complex, dynamic processes of substrate-catalyzed carbon growth (e.g., graphene on Cu(111)), capture rare events, and understand growth mechanisms to design substrates for desired nanostructures.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `SystemNode` attributes: `systemType`: HybridSimulationFramework, `domain`: MaterialsScience_SurfaceGrowth, `mechanism`: ActiveLearning_MLPotential_MD_MC, `components`: [GAP, SOAP, DFT, MD, tfMC, ActiveLearningLoop], `purpose`: SimulateCarbonGrowthDynamics_SubstrateDesign
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes the synergistic approach, the components used (GAP, MD/tfMC, SOAP, DFT), the active learning strategy, and the overall goal of simulating carbon growth mechanisms.

### **1.2 Implementation Clarity**

*   **Vector ID:** M1.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 8
    *   Justification: The paper clearly outlines the overall workflow (Fig. 1), the specific techniques used (GAP, SOAP, MD/tfMC, DFT via CP2K), the active learning query strategy (Dave, Dmax thresholds), and provides key simulation parameters (e.g., sampling rate N_f, error thresholds). The methodology section details the MD/tfMC setup and the MLP training/selection. Some specific hyperparameters for GAP/SOAP are mentioned or referred to (Supplementary Methods/Figs), but a fully exhaustive list might require consulting the supplementary information and cited works. The connection between specific parameters (N_f, Save, Smax) and resulting accuracy is demonstrated (Fig 1c).
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The overall workflow and key components are explicit. Full details of all hyperparameters might be implicit, requiring reference to supplementary materials or cited papers, but the core implementation logic is explicitly described.

    *   Table:
        | Parameter Name | Value | Units | Source (Fig/Table/Section) | Implicit/Explicit | Data Reliability (High/Medium/Low) | Derivation Method (if Implicit) |

## M2: Energy Flow
*   **Vector ID:** M2
*   **Vector Type:** Energy

### **2.1 Energy Input**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.1
*   **Vector Type:** Input
    *   Content: The primary energy input during the simulation's deposition phase is the kinetic energy of the impinging carbon atoms directed towards the metal substrate. Specific values are tested. DFT calculations provide the potential energy landscape information used to train the MLP, which guides the energy evolution during MD/tfMC.
    *   Value: 2.5 - 10.0 (tested range)
    *   Units: eV (per incident C atom)
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyInputNode`: attributes - `source`: IncidentCarbonAtom, `type`: KineticEnergy
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly states the kinetic energies (Ek) used for the incident carbon atoms in different simulation runs (e.g., Fig 2 captions, Fig 3a labels).

### **2.2 Energy Transduction**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.2
*   **Vector Type:** Transduction
    *   Content: Incident kinetic energy is transduced into several forms upon impact: 1) Potential energy changes associated with adsorption onto the surface or diffusion into the subsurface. 2) Potential energy changes associated with C-C and C-metal bond formation/breaking (e.g., dimer, chain, ring formation). 3) Thermal energy within the substrate (Cu atoms) as kinetic energy is absorbed and dissipated (simulated via thermostatting in MD). 4) Energy associated with defect creation (e.g., creating adatoms/vacancies on the Cu surface). The CGM-MLP calculates potential energy and forces, mediating the conversion between kinetic and potential energy according to learned DFT data. The tfMC method uses force biasing, influencing the trajectory based on potential energy gradients to accelerate sampling.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: `EnergyTransductionEdge`: attributes - `mechanism`: [ImpactScattering, Adsorption, Diffusion, BondFormation, BondBreaking, Thermalization], `from_node`: EnergyInputNode (Kinetic), `to_node`: [PotentialEnergyNode (SystemConfiguration), ThermalEnergyNode (Substrate)]
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly mentions incident kinetic energy (Fig 2, 3) and discusses the resulting processes like adsorption, diffusion, bond formation (dimers, chains, rings), and creation of surface defects (adatoms), implying kinetic-to-potential energy conversion. Thermalization is implicit in the use of MD/tfMC simulations of deposition processes which require energy dissipation/thermostatting (mentioned in Methods). The role of the MLP in mediating energy calculations is explicit.

### **2.3 Energy Efficiency**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.3
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: N/A
    *   Justification/Metrics: Energy efficiency in the sense of energy conversion/harvesting is not a relevant metric for this system. The goal is computational efficiency and accuracy in simulating physical energy transformations (kinetic to potential/thermal). The computational efficiency is implicitly high compared to pure AIMD, allowing larger scales, but a numerical efficiency score isn't provided or applicable in a thermodynamic sense. The accuracy of the energy calculations is assessed via MAE relative to DFT (<0.05 eV/atom).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
      *  Justification: The concept of thermodynamic energy efficiency is not discussed or relevant. Computational efficiency is discussed qualitatively ("practical and efficient approach"). Accuracy metrics (MAE) are provided explicitly.

### **2.4 Energy Dissipation**

*   **Vector ID:** M2.4
*   **Vector Type:** Dissipation
    *   Content: The primary energy dissipation mechanism is the thermalization of the incident carbon atom's kinetic energy and energy released during bond formation into the metal substrate (lattice vibrations/phonons). This is implicitly handled by the thermostat applied during the MD simulation phase (NVT ensemble mentioned, velocity rescaling wall also used for dissipation). High kinetic energy impacts (e.g., 10 eV) can also lead to energy dissipation through bond breaking (Fig 3b). Quantification of dissipation rates is not provided, but it's implicitly managed to maintain system temperature. Qualitative assessment: Dissipation is crucial and effectively managed by the simulation method (MD thermostatting).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Creates `EnergyDissipationNode` (Thermalization_Substrate, BondBreaking) and `EnergyDissipationEdge` representing energy loss from kinetic/potential to dissipation nodes.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper mentions MD simulations (often using thermostats) and the physical processes (impact, bond formation/breaking) imply energy dissipation into the substrate, but explicit mechanisms or quantification of dissipation rates are not detailed. The velocity rescaling wall (Methods) explicitly aims to prevent energy recycling, confirming dissipation management.

## M3: Memory
*   **Vector ID:** M3
*   **Vector Type:** Memory

### **3.1 Memory Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The system exhibits memory in two main ways: 1) **ML Potential Memory:** The CGM-MLP itself acts as a form of memory, encoding the relationship between atomic configurations and their energies/forces learned from past DFT calculations in the training set. This encoded information dictates the system's evolution in subsequent MD/tfMC steps. The training set grows via active learning, continuously updating this memory. 2) **Physical System State Memory:** The simulated physical system (carbon atoms on metal surface) inherently possesses memory in its configuration. The arrangement of atoms (chains, rings, islands, subsurface C), which results from the history of deposition events (sequence, energy, location), directly influences subsequent events like diffusion barriers, attachment sites, and reaction pathways. For example, the formation of a dimer influences where the next atom is likely to attach.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The role of the training set and MLP as encoding past information is explicit in the description of the active learning framework. The influence of the current physical configuration (resulting from past events) on future dynamics is inherent to molecular simulation and explicitly shown in the described growth sequences (Fig 2), making it physical system state memory.

### **3.2 Memory Type:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
*   Score: 5
*   Justification:
    *   **ML Potential Memory:** This memory (the trained potential) is highly stable once trained (low degradation mentioned implicitly via stable low MAE). It is re-writable through the active learning process (adding new DFT data). Capacity depends on the size and diversity of the training set (hundreds to thousands of configurations implicitly). Read-out accuracy is measured by the potential's prediction error vs DFT (Force MAE ~0.43 eV/Å, Energy MAE ~0.013 eV/atom). This memory is closer to a learned model or knowledge base. (Score contribution: ~7/10 for this aspect).
    *   **Physical System State Memory:** This is the structural arrangement of atoms. Retention depends on the stability of formed structures and energy barriers for rearrangement (e.g., dimers, chains, graphene islands are persistent configurations). Capacity relates to the vast number of possible atomic configurations. Read-out is implicitly perfect within the simulation (the configuration *is* the state). It's less like rewritable 'data' memory and more like the physical state history common to any evolving physical system. (Score contribution: ~3/10 for this aspect in a cognitive sense).
    *   **Combined:** The overall score reflects a system where memory is crucial (MLP) and physical state history matters, but it doesn't strongly resemble biological memory types or easily reconfigurable digital memory. It lacks features like selective recall or associative memory in a cognitive sense. The memory is primarily representational (MLP) or structural (physical state). The score of 5 reflects the significant role of the learned potential (higher aspect) combined with the less 'cognitive' physical state memory (lower aspect).
*   CT-GIN Mapping: `MemoryNode` type: MachineLearningPotential, `MemoryNode` type: PhysicalConfigurationState. Attributes could include `TrainingSetSize`, `MAE_Energy`, `MAE_Force` for MLP; `StructureType`, `FormationEnergy` for physical state.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
    * Justification: The existence and retraining of the MLP are explicit. Its accuracy metrics (MAE) are explicit. The physical configuration evolving based on history is explicit from simulation descriptions (Fig 2). The interpretation and scoring against different memory types involve some inference based on the nature of ML potentials and physical simulations.

### **3.3 Memory Retention Time:**

*   **Vector ID:** M3.3
*   **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: Long-term (MLP); Variable/Simulation-dependent (Physical State)
*    Units: N/A (Qualitative)
*   Justification:
    *   **ML Potential Memory:** Once trained (within an active learning loop or finalized), the GAP potential is static unless retrained. Its "retention" is effectively permanent for the duration of its use. Degradation isn't discussed, suggesting it's assumed stable. Classified as Long-term.
    *   **Physical System State Memory:** The persistence of a specific atomic configuration (e.g., a C dimer) depends on the energy barriers for diffusion or reaction, temperature, and subsequent impacts. Some states (like stable graphene nuclei) can persist for the simulation duration, while others (transient C monomers on surface) are short-lived. Retention is thus variable and depends on the specific physical state and simulation conditions.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: Stability of the trained MLP is implicit (not discussed as degrading). The variable persistence of physical configurations is implicit based on the physics being simulated and explicitly shown by the evolution in Fig 2 (e.g., C1 monomers moving subsurface).
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `RetentionTime` of `MemoryNode` (MLP: LongTerm, PhysicalState: Variable).

### **3.4 Memory Capacity (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.4
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*  Value: Variable (MLP); Very High (Physical State)
*   Units: Number of training configurations (MLP); Number of possible atomic states (Physical State)
*   Justification:
    *   **ML Potential Memory:** Capacity relates to the complexity it can represent, influenced by the size and diversity of the training dataset. The paper implies datasets grow during active learning, reaching adequate coverage (low MAE). The final dataset size isn't explicitly stated but typically involves thousands of configurations for GAP.
    *   **Physical System State Memory:** Capacity is the astronomically large number of possible arrangements of C and metal atoms in the simulation box.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The concept of training set size influencing the potential is standard ML practice (implicit). The vastness of configurational space is inherent to atomistic systems (implicit). Exact dataset size is not stated.
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `Capacity` of `MemoryNode`.

### **3.5 Readout Accuracy (Optional - if applicable)**

* **Vector ID:** M3.5
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
*   Value: MLP: Energy MAE ~0.013 eV/atom, Force MAE ~0.43 eV/Å. Physical State: 100%
*   Units: eV/atom, eV/Å (MLP); % (Physical State)
*   Justification:
    *   **ML Potential Memory:** "Readout" accuracy is the accuracy with which the potential predicts energy/forces compared to the ground truth (DFT). The paper explicitly states converged MAE values.
    *   **Physical System State Memory:** Within the simulation, the current atomic configuration *is* the state; readout is inherently perfect by definition.
*    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (for MLP MAE); Implicit (for Physical State)
       *  Justification: MLP MAE values are explicitly given in the Results section. The perfect readout of the physical state is implicit based on how simulations work (the coordinates define the state).
*   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `ReadoutAccuracy` or specific `MAE` attributes of `MemoryNode` (MLP).

### **3.6 Degradation Rate (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.6
* **Vector Type:** Parameter
    *   Value: N/A (Assumed negligible for MLP)
    *   Units: N/A
    *   Justification: The paper does not discuss any degradation of the trained MLP over time. It is typically assumed that once trained, an ML potential is static and does not degrade unless explicitly retrained or if numerical issues arise (not mentioned). Physical state configurations change based on dynamics, not degradation in the memory sense.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
            * Justification: Lack of discussion implies degradation is not considered a factor for the MLP's performance during simulation runs.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Attribute `DegradationRate` of `MemoryNode` (MLP).

### **3.7 Memory Operations Energy Cost (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.7
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Memory Operation ID | Energy Consumption per Bit | Power Usage during Operation| Units | Uncertainty | Data Source Reference | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :---: |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:| :------------------ |
    | MLP Training (DFT) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Cost is computational (CPU/GPU time for DFT/fitting), not direct energy consumption per bit. |
    | MLP Inference (MD/tfMC) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Cost is computational time per simulation step. |
    | Physical State Update | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Implicit | Cost is physical energy change (ΔE) during simulation dynamics. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *   Justification: The paper focuses on simulating physical processes and the computational method's accuracy/efficiency (time), not the energy cost of computation or information storage in bits. These metrics are not relevant to the study's scope.

### **3.8 Memory Fidelity & Robustness Metrics (Optional - if applicable)**
* **Vector ID:** M3.8
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Metric ID | Description | Value | Units | CT-GIN Mapping | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :----: | :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |:-----------------:| :-----------------:|
    | MLP_MAE_E | MLP Energy Mean Absolute Error vs DFT | ~0.013 | eV/atom | MLP MemoryNode Attribute | Results (p.3) | Explicit | Measures accuracy of energy prediction (memory readout). |
    | MLP_MAE_F | MLP Force Mean Absolute Error vs DFT | ~0.43 | eV/Å | MLP MemoryNode Attribute | Results (p.3) | Explicit | Measures accuracy of force prediction (memory readout). |
    | PhysicalStatePersistence | Time a specific configuration lasts | Variable | fs / ps / SimulationSteps | PhysicalState MemoryNode Attribute | Fig 2 / Dynamics | Implicit | Qualitative observation from simulation dynamics. |
*   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
*   Justification: MLP error metrics are explicit measures of fidelity. Physical state persistence is implicitly observed but not systematically quantified as a memory robustness metric.

## M4: Self-Organization and Emergent Order
*   **Vector ID:** M4
*   **Vector Type:** Self-Organization

### **4.1 Self-Organization Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: Yes
    *   Justification: The simulation shows the spontaneous formation of ordered carbon structures (chains, rings, graphene islands) from randomly deposited individual carbon atoms. This ordering arises from the local interactions between C atoms and the metal substrate atoms, governed by the energy landscape defined by the CGM-MLP (which approximates DFT-level physics). There is no external controller dictating the final global structure; it emerges dynamically based on deposition conditions and local energy minimization.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes and shows (Fig 2) the formation of different carbon nanostructures (chains, rings, islands) resulting from the deposition simulation, framing it as substrate-catalyzed growth, which is inherently a self-organization process driven by atomistic interactions.

### **4.2 Local Interaction Rules:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.2
*   **Vector Type:** Rules
    *   Content: The local interaction rules are implicitly encoded within the CGM-MLP (Gaussian Approximation Potential). This potential function takes the local atomic environment (positions of neighbours within a cutoff radius, typically ~3.7 Å for C-C/C-Cu based on GAP defaults/Method section) of each atom as input and outputs the potential energy contribution and forces acting on that atom. The rules are complex, non-linear functions (sums of 2-body, 3-body, and SOAP many-body terms) fitted to DFT data, effectively representing the quantum mechanical interactions governing bonding, repulsion, adsorption, and diffusion at the atomic scale. Specific mathematical forms are standard for GAP (Ref 32, 34) but not fully reiterated in the paper. Key aspects derived from these rules include preferred subsurface sites for C monomers, stability of C dimers on the surface, energetic favorability of chains vs. rings (Fig 4b), and energy barriers for diffusion and reaction (Fig 4a, 4c).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Description defines the function F(R_i) -> {E_i, f_i} for the `AtomNode` where R_i is the local environment. Embodied in the parameters of the `MemoryNode` (MLP). Edges representing forces/energy contributions link atoms based on proximity (within cutoff). Rules define the "AtomisticInteraction" category.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
        *  Justification: The use of GAP/SOAP with cutoffs defining local environments is explicitly stated. The qualitative outcomes of these interactions (diffusion barriers, structure stability) are explicitly discussed and calculated (Fig 4). The precise mathematical form of the GAP potential implementing these rules is implicit, referencing prior work (Ref 32, 34).

### **4.2.1 Local Interaction Parameters:**

* **Vector ID:** M4.2.1
* **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Rule ID | Description | Parameter Name | Parameter Value Range | Units | Data Source | Implicit/Explicit | Justification |

    | GAP | 2-body Interaction | Cutoff | 3.7 | Å | Methods | Explicit | Defines range of pairwise interactions. |
    | GAP | 3-body Interaction | Cutoff | 2.5 | Å | Methods | Explicit | Defines range of triplet interactions. |
    | GAP | SOAP descriptor | Cutoff | 3.7 | Å | Methods | Explicit | Defines range of many-body environment. |

    | GAP | SOAP descriptor | n_max | 12 | Dimensionless | Methods | Explicit | Radial resolution of density expansion. |
    | CI-NEB | Dimer Formation Barrier | E_barrier | ~0.06 | eV/atom | Fig 4a | Explicit | Barrier for C monomer pair to form dimer. |
    | CI-NEB | Chain Formation Barrier (from dimers) | E_barrier | < 0.1 | eV/atom | Fig 4b | Explicit | Barrier for 4 dimers forming C8 chain. |
    | CI-NEB | Ring Formation Barrier (from dimers) | E_barrier | ~0.2 | eV/atom | Fig 4b | Explicit | Barrier for 4 dimers forming C8 ring. |
    | CI-NEB | Graphene Growth Barrier (Cu-passivated) | E_barrier | < 0.95 | eV/atom | Fig 4c | Explicit | Barrier for adding C3 unit to edge. |

### **4.3 Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.3
*   **Vector Type:** Order
    *   Content: The emergent global order depends on deposition conditions (primarily incident kinetic energy, Ek). Low Ek (2.5 eV) leads to 1D carbon chains. Moderate Ek (5.0-7.5 eV) leads to the formation of 2D hexagonal carbon rings and small graphene islands/nuclei. High Ek (10 eV) disrupts ring formation, leading to more disordered structures or fragmented chains. Order also includes preferred subsurface location for C monomers and surface location for C dimers, and specific orientations of graphene islands relative to the Cu(111) substrate (~10° misalignment observed, Fig 2b).
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `ConfigurationalNode` with attribute `StructureType`: [Chain, Ring, GrapheneIsland, Disordered, SubsurfaceMonomer, SurfaceDimer], `OrientationAngle`.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Explicit
        *  Justification: The paper explicitly describes and visualizes the different resulting carbon structures (chains, rings, islands) corresponding to different incident energies (Fig 2, Fig 3) and discusses orientations (Fig 2b).

### **4.4 Predictability of Global Order:**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.4
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The simulations show a generally predictable relationship between the input parameter (incident kinetic energy) and the resulting dominant type of global order (chains vs rings/islands vs disorder), as shown consistently in Fig 2. The model also reproduces experimentally observed trends on different substrates (Cu, Cr, Ti, Fig 5). However, atomistic simulations inherently involve stochasticity (deposition location, thermal motion). While the *type* of structure is predictable based on energy, the exact atomic configuration, defect locations, or island shapes/sizes for a specific run are not perfectly predictable without running the exact simulation. The alignment with experimental trends and DFT calculations (Fig 4, Fig 5) supports reasonable predictability. No quantitative predictability metrics (e.g., R-squared) are provided. The score reflects generally predictable trends but acknowledges inherent stochasticity.
    * **Implicit/Explicit**: Mixed
    *  Justification: The correlation between Ek and structure type is explicitly shown (Fig 2, 3). The agreement with experiment/DFT (Fig 4, 5) explicitly supports predictability. The inherent stochasticity of MD is implicit. Lack of quantitative predictability metrics makes the score partially qualitative.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Score influences the weight/reliability attribute of `AdjunctionEdge` linking `SystemInputNode` (e.g., Ek) to `ConfigurationalNode`.

### **4.7 Yoneda Embedding and Local-to-Global Mapping Fidelity**

*   **Vector ID:** M4.7
*   **Vector Type:** Table
*   Table:
    | Link Type | Description | Predictability | Yoneda Score | Metrics | Implicit/Explicit | Justification | Source |
    | :-------- | :---------- | :------------- | :----------- | :------ | :----------------: | :------------: | :-----: |
    | N/A | Local atomic interactions to global structure type | Medium-High (Score 7 from M4.4) | N/A | Qualitative correlation (Ek -> Structure Type) | Implicit | Yoneda embedding is not discussed or applied in the paper. The framework uses physical simulation, not explicit category theory mappings in this way. | N/A |
    *   **Yoneda Embedding Fulfillment Score [0-10]:** N/A
    *   **Metrics:** N/A
    *   **Justification:** The paper uses physics-based simulation (MD/MC guided by MLP) to map local interactions (encoded in MLP) to global emergent structures. It does not employ or discuss Category Theory concepts like the Yoneda Lemma for analyzing this mapping. Therefore, assessing Yoneda embedding fulfillment is not applicable based on the paper's content.

## M5: Computation
*   **Vector ID:** M5
*   **Vector Type:** Computation

### **5.1 Embodied Computation Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M5.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The computation (calculating energies and forces based on atomic positions) is performed by the external CGM-MLP model executed on a classical computer within the LAMMPS simulation environment. This computation *guides* the physical evolution of the simulated material system, but the computation itself is not intrinsic to the material's physical properties or dynamics within the simulation. The simulated material self-organizes based on physical laws approximated by the MLP, but it does not perform computation itself.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The paper describes a simulation methodology where an ML potential (external computation) drives the dynamics. It makes no claims about the simulated material itself performing computation. The interpretation that the computation resides in the simulation tool, not the simulated material, is based on understanding the methodology.

    *   **Note:** The simulations cover timescales from femtoseconds (MD steps) to potentially nanoseconds or longer (cumulative simulation time for 100 atoms), capturing fast impacts and slower diffusion/rearrangement processes.

### **6.2 Active Inference:**

*   **Vector ID:** M6.2
*   **Vector Type:** Assessment
    *   Content: No
    *   Justification: The paper does not describe the system in terms of active inference. The simulation follows trajectories based on forces derived from the MLP; there is no evidence of the simulated system predicting future states, selecting actions to minimize prediction error based on an internal model, or updating such a model based on experience within the simulation run itself. The active learning component updates the *external* MLP model (system's "physics rules") based on querying DFT, not the simulated *system* updating an internal world model to guide its actions.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
        *  Justification: The description focuses on accurate physical simulation using ML, lacking any mention of predictive coding, free energy principles, or internal models in the context of the simulated atoms' behavior. Absence of evidence.
    *   **If Yes/Partial, provide examples of testable CT-GIN metrics that *could* be used to quantify active inference:** N/A

## M7: Adaptation
*   **Vector ID:** M7
*   **Vector Type:** Adaptation

### **7.1 Adaptive Plasticity Presence:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.1
*   **Vector Type:** Binary
    *   Content: No (for the simulated physical system); Yes (for the simulation method/MLP)
    *   Justification:
        *   **Simulated Physical System:** The simulated carbon/metal system changes its structure over time due to deposition and atomic interactions (self-organization), but this is governed by fixed physical laws approximated by the (potentially adapting) MLP. The material itself doesn't change its *rules* of behavior or properties based on history to improve performance in a learning sense. It rearranges according to energy minimization.
        *   **Simulation Method (MLP):** The active learning framework exhibits adaptive plasticity. The CGM-MLP potential *adapts* by incorporating new DFT data points selected during the simulation, improving its accuracy (predictive performance) over the course of the training process. This change persists and improves future simulation steps guided by the updated potential.
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        * Justification: The adaptation of the MLP through active learning is explicitly described (Fig 1 workflow). The lack of adaptive plasticity *within* the simulated material (beyond structural rearrangement based on fixed laws) is implicit based on the simulation methodology described. The focus is on the model adapting to better describe physics, not the physics adapting.

**(Conditional: M7.1 is "No" for the material, "Yes" for the method. We focus on the material for M7.2, hence N/A, but acknowledge method adaptation.)**

### **7.2 Adaptation Mechanism:**

*   **Vector ID:** M7.2
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: N/A (for the simulated material). The adaptation mechanism pertains to the active learning method: New configurations encountered during MD/tfMC are evaluated using SOAP descriptors (Dave, Dmax). If a configuration is sufficiently dissimilar to the existing training set (exceeds Save/Smax thresholds), its energy/forces are calculated using DFT. This new data point is added to the training set, and the GAP potential (CGM-MLP) is refitted/updated, improving its accuracy for subsequent simulation steps.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A (for material). For method: defines `AdaptationNode` (ActiveLearning) and `Monad` edges representing the update loop (Simulate -> Select -> Calculate DFT -> Retrain MLP). Mechanism: "SupervisedLearning_ActiveSampling".
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit (for the method)
        *  Justification: The active learning mechanism (SOAP selection, DFT query, retraining) is explicitly described in the Results section and Fig 1.

## M8: Emergent Behaviors
*   **Vector ID:** M8
*   **Vector Type:** Behavior

### **8.1 Behavior Description:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: The main functional behaviors observed are the dynamic processes of carbon atom deposition, diffusion (surface and subsurface), and aggregation/self-organization on various metal substrates (Cu(111), Cr(110), Ti(001), O-Cu(111)). Specific emergent behaviors include:
        1.  Spontaneous diffusion of C monomers into the Cu(111) subsurface octahedral sites.
        2.  Formation and surface migration of C dimers.
        3.  Formation of 1D carbon chains, particularly at low incident energy.
        4.  Nucleation and growth of hexagonal carbon rings and 2D graphene islands, often involving Cu adatoms or steps, at moderate incident energy.
        5.  Breaking of carbon rings/bonds under high-energy ion impact.
        6.  Substrate-dependent crystallinity and nucleation rates (Cu > Cr > Ti).
        7.  Inhibition of graphene nucleation by surface oxygen contamination.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Defines `BehaviorArchetypeNode` with types: "SubsurfaceDiffusion", "DimerFormation", "SurfaceDiffusion", "ChainFormation", "RingNucleation", "GrapheneGrowth", "IonImpactDamage", "SubstrateDependentNucleation", "ImpurityInhibition".
    *    Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
       *  Justification: These behaviors are explicitly described, illustrated (Fig 2, 3, 5), and discussed throughout the Results section as key findings of the simulation.

### **8.2 Behavior Robustness:**

*   **Vector ID:** M8.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 7
    *   Justification: The described behaviors appear reasonably robust within the simulation framework. The correlation between incident energy and resulting structure type (chains vs rings vs disorder) is consistently shown (Fig 2). Key mechanistic steps (subsurface monomer, surface dimer, role of Cu adatoms) are reported as consistently observed and align with previous DFT studies (cited extensively). The model's predictions match experimental trends across different substrates (Fig 5). Robustness against noise is inherent in MD/MC simulations (thermal fluctuations included). Sensitivity to initial conditions or minor parameter variations beyond Ek isn't systematically explored, but repeated runs are mentioned (Supplementary Fig 12 implies reproducibility). The active learning ensures the potential is robust enough (low MAE) across relevant configuration space. Limitations might exist outside the explored parameter space or for very long timescales not simulated.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Mixed
        *  Justification: Consistency across energies (Fig 2) and substrates (Fig 5) is explicit. Agreement with DFT/experiment explicitly supports robustness/validity. Reproducibility mentioned via Supp Fig 12. Robustness to noise is implicit in MD. Lack of systematic perturbation analysis makes the score partially qualitative.
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: Score contributes to reliability attributes of `BehaviorArchetypeNode`s.

### **8.3 CT-GIN Emergent Behavior Validation**

*    **Vector ID:** M8.3
*    **Vector Type:** Validation
     *  Content: Validation of emergent behaviors relies on several methods:
        1.  **Comparison with DFT:** Energy barriers (CI-NEB calculations in Fig 4) and relative stabilities (e.g., monomer subsurface preference, chain vs ring favorability) calculated with CGM-MLP are directly compared against static DFT calculations, showing good agreement (errors generally < 0.2 eV/atom for barriers).
        2.  **Comparison with Previous Studies:** Observed mechanisms (e.g., subsurface monomer, dimer migration, role of adatoms/steps, chain stability) are explicitly stated to be consistent with findings from previous DFT studies and simulations (Refs 1, 4, 5, 7, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 52, 53).
        3.  **Comparison with Experiment:** Simulated trends in carbon film crystallinity and nucleation rate across different metal substrates (Cu > Cr > Ti) are shown to match experimental observations via HRTEM/SAED (Fig 5). The inhibiting effect of oxygen contamination also aligns with experimental findings (Ref 55).
        4.  **Visualization and Analysis:** Simulation trajectories are visualized (Fig 2, Supp Movies) and analyzed (e.g., ring counting, hybridization analysis in Fig 3a) to characterize the emergent structures and processes.
        5.  **Reproducibility:** Mention of repeated runs (Supplementary Fig 12) provides some evidence for reproducibility.
     *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    *   Justification: The paper explicitly details the comparisons made to DFT calculations (Fig 4), previous theoretical/computational work (discussion throughout Results), and experimental results (Fig 5) as validation strategies. Analysis methods like ring counting are also mentioned (Fig 3a).

## M9: Cognitive Proximity
*   **Vector ID:** M9
*   **Vector Type:** Cognition

### **9.1 Cognitive Mapping:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.1
*   **Vector Type:** Description
    *   Content: None
    *   CT-GIN Mapping: N/A
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Explicit
    * Justification: The paper discusses the simulation methodology and the resulting physical phenomena (carbon growth mechanisms) without making any analogies or mappings to cognitive processes like learning (beyond the MLP training), decision-making, or perception in a biological or cognitive sense.

### **9.2 Cognitive Proximity Score:**

*   **Vector ID:** M9.2
*   **Vector Type:** Score
    *   Score: 1
    *   Justification: The system models physical self-organization based on energy minimization. While the active learning *method* involves updating a model (the MLP) based on new data, this occurs externally and serves to improve the accuracy of the physics simulation, not to enable cognitive function within the simulated material. The simulated material exhibits only basic stimulus-response (atom hits surface -> energy dissipates, atom diffuses) and physical state memory (structure depends on history). It lacks adaptation (rules don't change), goal-directedness, internal models for prediction/action selection, or any higher cognitive functions. The score reflects only the most basic level ofresponsivity inherent in any physical system simulation. It operates at Level 1 (Simple Responsivity) on the Cognizance Scale, purely based on the simulated physics.
    *   Implicit/Explicit: Implicit
    *  Justification: Score is based on assessing the described system behavior against the defined Cognizance Scale levels. The lack of features corresponding to higher levels justifies the low score.

**CT-GIN Cognizance Scale:**

*   **Level 0: Non-Cognitive:** Purely reactive system. No internal state beyond immediate stimulus-response.
*   **Level 1: Simple Responsivity:** Basic stimulus-response behavior. Reactions are fixed and predetermined. <-- **ASSIGNED LEVEL**
*   **Level 2: Sub-Organismal Responsivity:** Behavior exhibits basic forms of adaptation or plasticity, but lacks complex representation or goal-directedness.
*   **Level 3: Reactive/Adaptive Autonomy:** System adapts its behavior based on experience and feedback, but within a limited behavioral repertoire.
*   **Level 4: Goal-Directed/Model-Based Cognition:** System exhibits goal-directed behavior based on internal models of the world, allowing for planning and flexible action selection.
*   **Level 5: Contextual/Relational Cognition:** System understands and responds to relationships between objects, events, and concepts.
*   **Level 6: Abstract/Symbolic Cognition:** System can manipulate abstract concepts and symbols, enabling logical reasoning and problem-solving.
*   **Level 7: Social Cognition:** System exhibits social intelligence, understanding and interacting with other agents.
*   **Level 8: Metacognition/Self-Awareness:** System possesses awareness of its own internal states and cognitive processes.
*   **Level 9: Phenomenal Consciousness:** System exhibits subjective experience (qualia). (Currently theoretical for material systems)
*   **Level 10: Sapience/Self-Reflective Consciousness:** System possesses self-awareness, understanding of its own existence, and ability for complex abstract thought. (Currently theoretical for material systems)

### **13.2 Qualitative CT-GIN Assessment Conclusion:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.2
*   **Vector Type:** Textual Summary
    *   Content: This paper presents a sophisticated hybrid simulation framework combining Machine Learning (MLP), Molecular Dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC), and Density Functional Theory (DFT) via active learning to model carbon growth on metal surfaces. **Key Strengths** lie in its ability to accurately simulate complex, dynamic self-organization processes (chain, ring, graphene formation) over longer timescales than pure AIMD, capture rare events using tfMC, and reproduce experimental trends across different substrates. The system explicitly demonstrates memory via the adaptable MLP (encoding learned physics) and the persistent physical state of the simulated structure. Emergent behaviors (specific carbon structures based on conditions) are clearly shown and validated against DFT and experiments. **Key Limitations** from a CT-GIN/cognizant matter perspective include the lack of embodied computation (computation is external), the absence of adaptive plasticity within the simulated material itself (adaptation resides in the external MLP model), and very low cognitive proximity (system primarily shows basic physical responsivity and state memory). Energy flow is simulated, but concepts like efficiency or thermodynamic cost of computation/memory are not addressed. **Overall Assessment:** The work represents a powerful tool for materials simulation and design, demonstrating advanced modeling of self-organization. However, within the CT-GIN framework for cognizant matter, it represents a system where intelligence primarily resides in the external modeling technique (the learning MLP) rather than being embodied within the simulated material's dynamics. It provides a strong foundation for simulating emergent complexity but does not yet model material intelligence functions like intrinsic learning, decision-making, or computation.
### **13.3 CT-GIN Refinement Directions:**

*   **Vector ID:** M13.3
*   **Vector Type:** Recommendations
    *   Content:
        *   **Embodied Computation:** Explore modifications where local material properties *within* the simulation framework could perform simple computations (e.g., local state influencing reaction rates non-linearly beyond simple energetics, mimicking thresholding or logic).
        *   **Intrinsic Adaptation:** Develop models where material properties (e.g., local site reactivity, diffusion barriers) can *evolve* within the simulation based on history or local environmental cues, moving beyond fixed physics approximated by the MLP.
        *   **Enhanced Memory Metrics:** Quantify the retention times and effective capacity of the structural memory (persistence of specific configurations like chains/rings) under different conditions.
        *   **Thermodynamic Costing:** Integrate methods to estimate the thermodynamic costs (e.g., entropy production, energy dissipation rates) associated with the self-organization processes and potentially link them to information processing metrics.
        *   **Longer Timescale Dynamics:** Investigate methods (beyond tfMC) or optimized potentials to access significantly longer timescales relevant to macroscopic growth or longer-term adaptation.
        *   **Goal-Directed Behavior:** Introduce objective functions or feedback mechanisms within the simulation framework that could potentially guide the self-organization towards specific target structures or functionalities, exploring rudimentary goal-directedness.

*Description: The graph shows the simulation system (`Components`) taking kinetic energy (`Input`) and using an actively learned MLP (`MLP`, a form of memory) to define local `InteractionRules`. These rules guide MD and tfMC processes acting on the `PhysicalState` (another memory form). MD/tfMC generate configurations used by `ActiveLearning` (adaptation) to query `DFT` and update the `MLP`. The dynamics lead to emergent `ConfigOrder` manifesting as various `Behaviors`. Energy is dissipated (`Dissipation`).*

## M16: CT-GIN Template Self-Improvement Insights

*   **Vector ID:** M16
*   **Vector Type:** Feedback

### **Template Feedback:**

*    **Vector ID:** M16.1
*   **Vector Type:** Text
    *   **Missing Probes:**
        *   Distinction between simulated system properties and simulation method properties could be clearer, especially for Memory (M3) and Adaptation (M7). Perhaps sub-sections like "M3.x - Intrinsic Material Memory" vs "M3.y - Methodological Memory".
        *   A probe for "Computational Cost" (e.g., CPU hours, scaling with system size) vs "Thermodynamic Cost" might be useful, as M2 (Energy) is thermodynamic, but M5 (Computation) often relates to computational resources in simulation papers.
    *   **Unclear Definitions:**
        *   The definition of "Embodied Computation" (M5.1) is good, but applying it to simulations where the computation *causes* the embodiment requires careful interpretation – maybe add a clarifying note about simulation vs physical realization.
        *   The Yoneda Embedding section (M4.7) seems highly specialized and unlikely to be directly addressed in most standard materials physics papers. Its relevance/utility might need clearer justification or examples of how it would be applied practically in this context. For this paper, it was N/A.
    *   **Unclear Node/Edge Representations:** Guidance was generally sufficient, but examples could be more diverse. For instance, how to represent the active learning loop explicitly using CT-GIN terms (Monads? Adjunctions?) could be elaborated. The provided Mermaid graph is a good start but translating the formal CT-GIN structure (Nodes, Edges, Categories, Functors) into actionable KGs needs consistent conventions.
    *   **Scoring Difficulties:**
        *   Cognitive Proximity Score (M9.2) relies heavily on the provided scale, which maps well to biological/psychological cognition but less directly to emergent material behavior. Scoring low-level physical systems can feel subjective; more granular descriptions for levels 0-3 might help.
        *   Handling "N/A" scores in the overall CT-GIN Readiness Score (M13.1) calculation (using 0) might unduly penalize papers where a module is simply not applicable (like M2.3 here). A weighted average or alternative calculation might be better.
        *   Predictability of Global Order (M4.4) often lacks quantitative metrics in papers, making the score qualitative.
    *   **Data Extraction/Output Mapping:** Mapping simulation parameters (M1.3) and timescales (M6.1) was straightforward. Separating intrinsic material properties from simulation method properties required conscious effort throughout. Ensuring consistency in distinguishing the 'system being simulated' vs the 'simulation tool' is key.
    *   **Overall Usability:** The template is very detailed and comprehensive, which is good for capturing nuance. However, its length and the theoretical depth of some sections (e.g., Yoneda) might make it challenging to apply consistently across diverse papers without significant expertise in both materials science and CT/GIN. Clearer examples integrated within the template might improve usability. The strict formatting rules are clear but demanding.
    * **Specific Suggestions:**
        *   Add explicit sub-sections in M3 and M7 to differentiate intrinsic material properties from simulation methodology properties.
        *   Clarify the intended application/interpretation of M4.7 (Yoneda) or make it optional/conditional.
        *   Provide more diverse CT-GIN mapping examples, especially for dynamic processes like active learning.
        *   Refine the calculation method for the overall score (M13.1) to handle N/A responses more gracefully.
        *   Consider adding a "Computational Cost" module separate from thermodynamic energy flow.
