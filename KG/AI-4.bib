	abstract = {This review paper offers an overview of the history and future of active inference—a unifying perspective on action and perception. Active inference is based upon the idea that sentient behavior depends upon our brains’ implicit use of internal models to predict, infer, and direct action. Our focus is upon the conceptual roots and development of this theory of (basic) sentience and does not follow a rigid chronological narrative. We trace the evolution from Helmholtzian ideas on unconscious inference, through to a contemporary understanding of action and perception. In doing so, we touch upon related perspectives, the neural underpinnings of active inference, and the opportunities for future development. Key steps in this development include the formulation of predictive coding models and related theories of neuronal message passing, the use of sequential models for planning and policy optimization, and the importance of hierarchical (temporally) deep internal (i.e., generative or world) models. Active inference has been used to account for aspects of anatomy and neurophysiology, to offer theories of psychopathology in terms of aberrant precision control, and to unify extant psychological theories. We anticipate further development in all these areas and note the exciting early work applying active inference beyond neuroscience. This suggests a future not just in biology, but in robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.},

It rehearses the key steps using standard results from statistical physics. These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.},

The main results are a method or principle of least action that can be used to emulate the behaviour of particles in open exchange with their external milieu. Particles are defined by a particular partition, in which internal states are individuated from external states by active and sensory blanket states. The variational principle at hand allows one to interpret internal dynamics—of certain kinds of particles—as inferring external states that are hidden behind blanket states. We consider different kinds of particles, and to what extent they can be imbued with an elementary form of inference or sentience. Specifically, we consider the distinction between dissipative and conservative particles, inert and active particles and, finally, ordinary and strange particles. Strange particles can be described as inferring their own actions, endowing them with apparent autonomy or agency. In short—of the kinds of particles afforded by a particular partition—strange kinds may be apt for describing sentient behaviour.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to introduce a field of study that has emerged over the last decade, called Bayesian mechanics. Bayesian mechanics is a probabilistic mechanics, comprising tools that enable us to model systems endowed with a particular partition (i.e. into particles), where the internal states (or the trajectories of internal states) of a particular system encode the parameters of beliefs about external states (or their trajectories). These tools allow us to write down mechanical theories for systems that look as if they are estimating posterior probability distributions over the causes of their sensory states. This provides a formal language for modelling the constraints, forces, potentials and other quantities determining the dynamics of such systems, especially as they entail dynamics on a space of beliefs (i.e. on a statistical manifold). Here, we will review the state of the art in the literature on the free energy principle, distinguishing between three ways in which Bayesian mechanics has been applied to particular systems (i.e. path-tracking, mode-tracking and mode-matching). We go on to examine a duality between the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy principle, both of which lie at the heart of Bayesian mechanics, and discuss its implications.},

	abstract = {Developing a thermodynamic theory of computation is a challenging task at the interface of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and computer science. In particular, this task requires dealing with difficulties such as stochastic halting times, unidirectional (possibly deterministic) transitions, and restricted initial conditions, features common in real-world computers. Here, we present a framework which tackles all such difficulties by extending the martingale theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to generic nonstationary Markovian processes, including those with broken detailed balance and/or absolute irreversibility. We derive several universal fluctuation relations and second-law-like inequalities that provide both lower and upper bounds on the intrinsic dissipation (mismatch cost) associated with any periodic process—in particular, the periodic processes underlying all current digital computation. Crucially, these bounds apply even if the process has stochastic stopping times, as it does in many computational machines. We illustrate our results with exhaustive numerical simulations of deterministic finite automata processing bit strings, one of the fundamental models of computation from theoretical computer science. We also provide universal equalities and inequalities for the acceptance probability of words of a given length by a deterministic finite automaton in terms of thermodynamic quantities, and outline connections between computer science and stochastic resetting. Our results, while motivated from the computational context, are applicable far more broadly.

Utilizing a synergistic approach of molecular dynamics and time-stamped force-biased Monte Carlo methods, augmented by the Gaussian Approximation Potential, we perform fully dynamic simulations of graphene growth on Cu(111). Our findings accurately replicate essential subprocesses–from the preferred diffusion of carbon monomer/dimer, chain or ring formations to edge-passivated Cu-aided graphene growth and bond breaks by ion impacts. Extending our simulations to carbon deposition on metal surfaces like Cu(111), Cr(110), Ti(001), and oxygen-contaminated Cu(111), our results align closely with experimental observations, providing a practical and efficient approach for designing metallic or alloy substrates to achieve desired carbon nanostructures and explore further reaction possibilities.},

We emulate training using repeated pulses of forskolin and/or phorbol ester, and, as a proxy for memory, measure luciferase expression at various points after training. Four spaced pulses of either agonist elicit stronger and more sustained luciferase expression than a single “massed” pulse. Spaced pulses also result in stronger and more sustained activation of molecular factors critical for memory formation, ERK and CREB, and inhibition of ERK or CREB blocks the massed-spaced effect.

	abstract = {To not only survive, but also thrive, the brain must efficiently orchestrate distributed computation across space and time. This requires hierarchical organisation facilitating fast information transfer and processing at the lowest possible metabolic cost. Quantifying brain hierarchy is difficult but can be estimated from the asymmetry of information flow. Thermodynamics has successfully characterised hierarchy in many other complex systems. Here, we propose the ‘Thermodynamics of Mind’ framework as a natural way to quantify hierarchical brain orchestration and its underlying mechanisms. This has already provided novel insights into the orchestration of hierarchy in brain states including movie watching, where the hierarchy of the brain is flatter than during rest. Overall, this framework holds great promise for revealing the orchestration of cognition.},

By including current-density correlations we, moreover, derive a new sharpened TUR for transient dynamics. Our arguably simplest and most direct proof, together with the new generalizations, allows us to systematically determine conditions under which the different TURs saturate and thus allows for a more accurate thermodynamic inference.

We use self-assembling α-helical barrels (αHBs) with central channels that can be altered predictably to vary their sizes, shapes and chemistries. The channels accommodate environment-sensitive dyes that fluoresce upon binding. Challenging arrays of dye-loaded barrels with analytes causes differential fluorophore displacement. The resulting fluorimetric fingerprints are used to train machine-learning models that relate the patterns to the analytes. We show that this system discriminates between a range of biomolecules, drink, and diagnostically relevant biological samples. As αHBs are robust and chemically diverse, the system has potential to sense many analytes in various settings.},

To achieve automated dynamical control of such self-assembled structures and transitions between them, we need to identify the fundamental aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics that can enable such processes. Here we identify programmable non-reciprocal interactions as a tool to achieve such functionalities. The design rule is composed of reciprocal interactions that lead to the equilibrium assembly of the different structures, through a process denoted as multifarious self-assembly, and non-reciprocal interactions that give rise to non-equilibrium dynamical transitions between the structures. The design of such self-organized shape-shifting structures can be implemented at different scales, from nucleic acids and peptides to proteins and colloids.},

This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals forces forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals forces instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and physical alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical damage without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals forces upon mechanical damage is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated alternating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.},

The defects are important in understanding the fundamental properties of the systems, as well as in practical applications, such as colloidal self-assembly, optical vortex generation and templates for molecular self-assembly. Usually, spatially and temporally stable defects require geometrical frustration imposed by surfaces; otherwise, the system relaxes because of the high cost of the elastic energy. So far, multiple defects are kept in bulk nematic liquid crystals by top-down lithographic techniques. In this work, we stabilize a large number of umbilical defects by doping with an ionic impurity. This method does not require pre-patterned surfaces. We demonstrate that molecular reorientation controlled by an AC voltage induces periodic density modulation of ions accumulated at an electrically insulating polymer interface, resulting in self-organization of a two-dimensional square array of umbilical defects that is reconfigurable and tunable.},

Among the DNA computing primitives used today, DNA strand displacement (DSD) is arguably the most popular, with DSD-based circuit applications ranging from disease diagnostics to molecular artificial neural networks. The outputs of DSD circuits are generally read using fluorescence spectroscopy. However, due to the spectral overlap of typical small-molecule fluorescent reporters, the number of unique outputs that can be detected in parallel is limited, requiring complex optical setups or spatial isolation of reactions to make output bandwidths scalable. Here, we present a multiplexable sequencing-free readout method that enables real-time, kinetic measurement of DSD circuit activity through highly parallel, direct detection of barcoded output strands using nanopore sensor array technology (Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION device). These results increase DSD output bandwidth by an order of magnitude over what is currently feasible with fluorescence spectroscopy.},

Such an iterative in-memory factorizer is shown to solve at least five orders of magnitude larger problems that cannot be solved otherwise, as well as substantially lowering the computational time and space complexity. We present a large-scale experimental demonstration of the factorizer by employing two in-memory compute chips based on phase-change memristive devices. The dominant matrix–vector multiplication operations take a constant time, irrespective of the size of the matrix, thus reducing the computational time complexity to merely the number of iterations. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate the ability to reliably and efficiently factorize visual perceptual representations.},

However, true autonomy remains an open challenge despite substantial progress made with externally supervised and manipulated systems. To accelerate the development of autonomous microrobots, alternatives to conventional top‐down lithography are sought. Such additive technologies like printing, coating, and colloidal self‐assembly allow for rapid prototyping and access to novel materials, such as polymers, bio‐ and nanomaterials. On the basis of recent experimental findings that memristive networks can be rapidly printed and lifted off as electronic microparticles, an alternative design paradigm is introduced based on arrays of two‐terminal memristive elements, which enables real‐time use of memory, sensing, and actuation in microrobots. Several memristor‐based designs are validated, each representing a key building block toward robotic autonomy: tracking elapsed time, timestamping a rare event, continuously cataloguing time‐indexed data, and accessing the collected information for a feedback‐controlled response as in a robotic glucose‐responsive insulin. The computational results establish an actionable framework for microrobotic design—tasks normally requiring complex circuits can now be achieved with self‐assembled and printed memristor arrays within microparticles.},

	abstract = {At the microscale, coupled physical interactions between collectives of agents can be exploited to enable self-organization. Past systems typically consist of identical agents; however, heterogeneous agents can exhibit asymmetric pairwise interactions which can be used to generate more diverse patterns of self-organization. Here, we study the effect of size heterogeneity in microrobot collectives composed of circular, magnetic microdisks on a fluid–air interface. Each microrobot spins or oscillates about its center axis in response to an external oscillating magnetic field, in turn producing local magnetic, hydrodynamic, and capillary forces that enable diverse collective behaviors. We demonstrate through physical experiments and simulations that the heterogeneous collective can exploit the differences in microrobot size to enable programmable self-organization, density, morphology, and interaction with external passive objects. Specifically, we can control the level of self-organization by microrobot size, enable organized aggregation, dispersion, and locomotion, change the overall shape of the collective from circular to ellipse, and cage or expel objects. We characterize the fundamental self-organization behavior across a parameter space of magnetic field frequency, relative disk size, and relative populations; we replicate the behavior through a physical model and a swarming coupled oscillator model to show that the dominant effect stems from asymmetric interactions between the different-sized disks. Our work furthers insights into self-organization in heterogeneous microrobot collectives and moves us closer to the goal of applying such collectives to programmable self-assembly and active matter.},

We discovered a simple motion law for moving and interacting self-propelled particles leading to a self-structuring, self-reproducing and self-sustaining life-like system. The patterns emerging within this system resemble patterns found in living organisms. The emergent cells we found show a distinct life cycle and even create their own ecosystem from scratch. These structures grow and reproduce on their own, show self-driven behavior and interact with each other. Here we analyze the macroscopic properties of the emerging ecology, as well as the microscopic properties of the mechanism that leads to it. Basic properties of the emerging structures (size distributions, longevity) are analyzed as well as their resilience against sensor or actuation noise. Finally, we explore parameter space for potential other candidates of life. The generality and simplicity of the motion law provokes the thought that one fundamental rule, described by one simple equation yields various structures in nature: it may work on different time- and size scales, ranging from the self-structuring universe, to emergence of living beings, down to the emergent subatomic formation of matter.},

	abstract = {From bird flocks to fish schools, animal groups often seem to react to environmental perturbations as if of one mind. Most studies in collective animal behavior have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may emerge from simple behavioral rules. Less effort has been devoted to understanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a whole reacts to its environment. Yet, in the presence of strong predatory pressure on the group, collective response may yield a significant adaptive advantage. Here we suggest that collective response in animal groups may be achieved through scale-free behavioral correlations. By reconstructing the 3D position and velocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what extent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each other. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a constant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result indicates that behavioral correlations are scale free: The change in the behavioral state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other animals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations provide each animal with an effective perception range much larger than the direct interindividual interaction range, thus enhancing global response to perturbations. Our results suggest that flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to environmental perturbations.},

Knowing how these patterns emerge and their functional role is important to our understanding of the evolution of biocomplexity and the role played by self organization. However, so far, conclusive evidence for local activation–long-range inhibition mechanisms in real biological systems has been elusive. Here a well-defined experimental and theoretical analysis of the pattern formation dynamics exhibited by clustering behavior in ant colonies is presented. These experiments and a simple mathematical model show that these colonies do indeed use this type of mechanism. All microscopic variables have been measured and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, for this type of self-organized behavior in complex biological systems, supporting early conjectures about its role in the organization of insect societies.},

The history and evolution of several self-repair systems is examined including nano-beam healing elements, passive self-healing, autonomic self-healing and ballistic self-repair. Self-healing mechanisms utilized in the design of these unusual materials draw much information from the related field of polymer–polymer interfaces and crack healing. The relationship of material damage to material healing is examined in a manner to provide an understanding of the kinetics and damage reversal processes necessary to impart self-healing characteristics. In self-healing systems, there are transitions from hard-to-soft matter in ballistic impact and solvent bonding and conversely, soft-to-hard matter transitions in high rate yielding materials and shear-thickening fluids. These transitions are examined in terms of a new theory of the glass transition and yielding, viz., the twinkling fractal theory of the hard-to-soft matter transition. Success in the design of self-healing materials has important consequences for material safety, product performance and enhanced fatigue lifetime.},

Nonetheless, dynamic materials with interchangeable mechanical states, which enable more diverse and versatile applications, are urgently necessary for intelligent and adaptive application cases in the future electronic and robot fields. Here, we report a gel-like material composed of a crosslinking polymer network impregnated with a phase changing molten liquid, which undergoes an exceptional stiffness transition in response to a thermal stimulus. Vice versa, the material switches from a soft gel state to a rigid solid state with a dramatic stiffness change of 105 times (601 MPa versus 4.5 kPa) benefiting from the liquid–solid phase change of the crystalline polymer once cooled. Such reversibility of the phase and mechanical transition upon thermal stimuli enables the dynamic gel mechanical transformation, demonstrating potential applications in an adhesive thermal interface gasket (TIG) to facilitate thermal transport, a high-temperature warning sensor and an intelligent gripper. Overall, this dynamic gel with a tunable stiffness change paves a new way to design and fabricate adaptive smart materials toward intelligent control of versatile devices.},

Still fewer materials can continue to exhibit previously learned behaviors in the midst of changing conditions (e.g., rising levels of internal damage, varying fixturing scenarios, and fluctuating external loads) while also acquiring new behaviors best suited for the situation at hand. Here, we describe a class of architected materials, called mechanical neural networks (MNNs), that achieve such learning capabilities by tuning the stiffness of their constituent beams similar to how artificial neural networks (ANNs) tune their weights. An example lattice was fabricated to demonstrate its ability to learn multiple mechanical behaviors simultaneously, and a study was conducted to determine the effect of lattice size, packing configuration, algorithm type, behavior number, and linear-versus-nonlinear stiffness tunability on MNN learning as proposed. Thus, this work lays the foundation for artificial-intelligent (AI) materials that can learn behaviors and properties.},

Embodied intelligence can be used as a tool to counter-act this phenomenon. Control functionality can be embedded directly into actuators by leveraging the characteristics of fluid flow phenomena. Whilst prior soft robotics work has focused exclusively on actuators operating in a state of transient/no flow (constant pressure), or pulsatile/alternating flow, our work begins to explore the possibilities granted by operating in the closed-loop flow recirculation regime. Here we introduce the concept of FlowBots: soft robots that utilise the characteristics of continuous fluid flow to enable the embodiment of complex control functionality directly into the structure of the robot. FlowBots have robust, integrated, no-moving-part control systems, and these architectures enable: monolithic additive man-ufacturing methods, rapid prototyping, greater sustainability, and an expansive range of applications. Based on three FlowBot examples: a bidirectional actuator, a gripper, and a quadruped with a swimming gait - we demonstrate how the characteristics of flow recirculation contribute to simplifications in fluidic analogue control architectures. We conclude by outlining our design and rapid prototyping methodology to empower others in the field to explore this new, emerging design field, and design their own FlowBots.},

	abstract = {Soft actuators and their sensors have always been separate entities with two distinct roles. The omnidirectional compliance of soft robots thus means that multiple sensors have to be used to sense different modalities in the respective planes of motion. With the recent emergence of self-sensing actuators, the two roles have gradually converged to simplify sensing requirements. Self-sensing typically involves embedding a conductive sensing element into the soft actuator and provides multiple state information along the continuum. However, most of these self-sensing actuators are fabricated through manual methods, which results in inconsistent sensing performance. Soft material compliance also imply that both actuator and sensor exhibit nonlinear behaviors during actuation, making sensing more complex. In this regard, machine learning has shown promise in characterizing the nonlinear behavior of soft sensors. Beyond characterization, we show that applying machine learning to soft actuators eliminates the need to implant a sensing element to achieve self-sensing. Fabrication is done using 3D printing, thus ensuring that sensing performance is consistent across the actuators. In addition, our proposed technique is able to estimate the bending curvature of a soft continuum actuator and the external forces applied to the tip of the actuator in real time. Our methodology is generalizable and aims to provide a novel way of multimodal sensing for soft robots across a variety of applications.},

Here we report a bioinspired soft sensor array (BOSSA) that integrates pressure and material sensing capabilities based on the triboelectric effect. Cascaded row + column electrodes embedded in low-modulus porous silicone rubber allow rich information to be captured from the environment and further analyzed by data-driven algorithms (multilayer perceptrons) to extract higher level features. BOSSA demonstrates the ability to identify 10 users (98.9\%) and identify the placement or extraction of 10 objects (98.6\%). Moreover, its scalable fabrication facilitates large-area sensor arrays with high spatiotemporal resolution and multimodal sensing abilities yet with a less complex system architecture. These features may be promising in the development of immersive sensing networks for intelligent monitoring and stimuli response in smart home/industry applications.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Philosophical and theoretical debates on the multiple realisability of the cognitive have historically influenced discussions of the possible systems capable of instantiating complex functions like memory, learning, goal-directedness, and decision-making. These debates have had the corollary of undermining, if not altogether neglecting, the materiality and corporeality of cognition—treating material, living processes as “hardware” problems that can be abstracted out and, in principle, implemented in a variety of materials—in particular on digital computers and in the form of state-of-the-art neural networks. In sum, the matter {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in se{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} has been taken not to matter for cognition. However, in this paper, we argue that the materiality of cognition—and the living, self-organizing processes that it enables—requires a more detailed assessment when understanding the nature of cognition and recreating it in the field of embodied robotics. Or, in slogan form, that the matter matters for cognitive form and function. We pull from the fields of Active Matter Physics, Soft Robotics, and Basal Cognition literature to suggest that the imbrication between material and cognitive processes is closer than standard accounts of multiple realisability suggest. In light of this, we propose upgrading the notion of multiple realisability from the standard version—what we call 1.0—to a more nuanced conception 2.0 to better reflect the recent empirical advancements, while at the same time averting many of the problems that have been raised for it. These fields are actively reshaping the terrain in which we understand materiality and how it enables, mediates, and constrains cognition. We propose that taking the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}materiality{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} of our embodied, precarious nature seriously furnishes an important research avenue for the development of embodied robots that autonomously value, engage, and interact with the environment in a goal-directed manner, in response to existential needs of survival, persistence, and, ultimately, reproduction. Thus, we argue that by placing further emphasis on the soft, active, and plastic nature of the materials that constitute cognitive embodiment, we can move further in the direction of autonomous embodied robots and Artificial Intelligence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we introduce an inverse-design framework to discover flexible mechanical metamaterials with a target nonlinear dynamic response. The desired dynamic task is encoded via optimal tuning of the full-scale metamaterial geometry through an inverse-design approach powered by a fully differentiable simulation environment. By deploying such a strategy, mechanical metamaterials are tailored for energy focusing, energy splitting, dynamic protection and nonlinear motion conversion. Furthermore, our design framework can be expanded to automatically discover reprogrammable architectures capable of switching between different dynamic tasks. For instance, we encode two strongly competing tasks—energy focusing and dynamic protection—within a single architecture, using static precompression to switch between these behaviours. The discovered designs are physically realized and experimentally tested, demonstrating the robustness of the engineered tasks. Our approach opens an untapped avenue towards designer materials with tailored robotic-like reprogrammable functionalities.},

We show experimentally that the SWNT/POM network generates spontaneous spikes and noise. We propose electron-cascading models of the network consisting of heterogeneous molecular junctions that yields results in good agreement with the experimental results. Rudimentary learning ability of the network is illustrated by introducing reservoir computing, which utilises spiking dynamics and a certain degree of network complexity.

However, notwithstanding relevant advancements such as shape reconfigurability, that have been demonstrated, there is no evidence for their computing capability, including the emulation of synaptic functions, which requires complex non-linear dynamics. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that a Fe3O4 water-based ferrofluid (FF) can perform electrical analogue computing and be programmed using quasi direct current (DC) signals and read at radio frequency (RF) mode. Features have been observed in all respects attributable to a memristive behavior, featuring both short and long-term information storage capacity and plasticity. The colloid is capable of classifying digits of a 8 × 8 pixel dataset using a custom in-memory signal processing scheme, and through physical reservoir computing by training a readout layer. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of in-memory computing using an amorphous FF system in a liquid aggregation state. This work poses the basis for the exploitation of a FF colloid as both an in-memory computing device and as a full-electric liquid computer thanks to its fluidity and the reported complex dynamics, via probing read-out and programming ports.},

Programming multiple behaviors and functions into a single material could increase its utility and adaptability to ever-changing environmental conditions. A swellable and stretchable metamaterial hydrogel or “metasponge” engineered to morph into customized sizes and shapes that dynamically tune its physical properties and functions is reported. Multiple case studies that take advantage of the morphing properties of the metasponge, including robotic actuation, light guidance, optical and sonic invisibility (“cloaking”), adaptation of propulsion mode, sampling, and multiple biomedical applications, are illustrated.

Consequently, NWNs may also emulate the synaptic processes that enable higher-order cognitive functions such as learning and memory. A quintessential cognitive task used to measure human working memory is the n-back task. In this study, task variations inspired by the n-back task are implemented in a NWN device, and external feedback is applied to emulate brain-like supervised and reinforcement learning. NWNs are found to retain information in working memory to at least n = 7 steps back, remarkably similar to the originally proposed “seven plus or minus two” rule for human subjects. Simulations elucidate how synapse-like NWN junction plasticity depends on previous synaptic modifications, analogous to “synaptic metaplasticity” in the brain, and how memory is consolidated via strengthening and pruning of synaptic conductance pathways.},

	abstract = {In biological neural networks, chemical communication follows the reversible integrate-and-fire (I\&F) dynamics model, enabling efficient, anti-interference signal transport. However, existing artificial neurons fail to follow the I\&F model in chemical communication, causing irreversible potential accumulation and neural system dysfunction. Herein, we develop a supercapacitively gated artificial neuron that mimics the reversible I\&F dynamics model. Upon upstream neurotransmitters, an electrochemical reaction occurs on a graphene nanowall (GNW) gate electrode of artificial neurons. Charging and discharging the supercapacitive GNWs mimic membrane potential accumulation and recovery, realizing highly efficient chemical communication upon use of acetylcholine down to 2 × 10–10 M. By combining artificial chemical synapses with axon-hillock circuits, the output of neural spikes is realized. With the same neurotransmitter and I\&F dynamics, the artificial neuron establishes chemical communication with other artificial neurons and living cells, holding promise as a basic unit to construct a neural network with compatibility to organisms for artificial intelligence and deep human–machine fusion.},

Recent laboratory prototypes of self-learning electronic circuits, such as “physical learning machines,” open the door to analog hardware that directly employs physics to learn desired functions from examples at a low energy cost. In this work, we show that this hardware platform allows for an even further reduction in energy consumption by using good initial conditions and a new learning algorithm. Using analytical calculations, simulations, and experiments, we show that a trade-off emerges when learning dynamics attempt to minimize both the error and the power consumption of the solution—greater power reductions can be achieved at the cost of decreasing solution accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate a practical procedure to weigh the relative importance of error and power minimization, improving the power efficiency given a specific tolerance to error.},

	abstract = {Active systems of self-propelled agents, e.g., birds, fish, and bacteria, can organize their collective motion into myriad autonomous behaviors. Ubiquitous in nature and across length scales, such phenomena are also amenable to artificial settings, e.g., where brainless self-propelled robots orchestrate their movements into spatial-temporal patterns via the application of external cues or when confined within flexible boundaries. Like their natural counterparts, these approaches typically require many units to initiate collective motion, so controlling the ensuing dynamics is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple mechanism that leverages nonlinear elasticity to tame near-diffusive motile particles in forming structures capable of directed motion and other emergent behaviors. Our elasto-active system comprises two centimeter-sized self-propelled microbots connected with elastic beams. These microbots exert forces that suffice to buckle the beam and set the structure in motion. We first rationalize the physics of the interaction between the beam and the microbots. Then we use reduced-order models to predict the interactions of our elasto-active structures with boundaries, e.g., walls and constrictions, and demonstrate how they can exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors such as maze navigation. These findings demonstrate that allowing and understanding changes in body morphology can enhance the capabilities of active matter systems and enable the design of robotic materials capable of space exploration, adaptation, and complex interactions with their surrounding environment.},

	abstract = {Intelligent agents collect and process information from their dynamically evolving neighborhood to efficiently navigate through it. However, agent-level intelligence does not guarantee that at the level of a collective; a common example is the jamming we observe in traffic flows. In this study, we ask: how and when do the interactions between intelligent agents translate to desirable or intelligent collective outcomes? To explore this question, we choose a collective consisting of two kinds of agents with opposing desired directions of movement. Agents in this collective are minimally intelligent: they possess only a single facet of intelligence, viz., memory, where the agents remember how well they were able to travel in their desired directions and make up for their non-optimal past. We find that dynamics due to the agent’s memory influences the collective, giving rise to diverse outcomes at the level of the group: from those that are undesirable to those that can be called “intelligent.” When memory is short term, local rearrangement of agents leads to the formation of symmetrically jammed arrangements that take longer to unjam. However, when agents remember across longer time-scales, their dynamics become sensitive to small differences in their movement history. This gives rise to heterogeneity in the movement that causes agents to unjam more readily and form lanes.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous oscillations on the order of several hertz are the drivers of many crucial processes in nature. From bacterial swimming to mammal gaits, converting static energy inputs into slowly oscillating power is key to the autonomy of organisms across scales. However, the fabrication of slow micrometre-scale oscillators remains a major roadblock towards fully-autonomous microrobots. Here, we study a low-frequency oscillator that emerges from a collective of active microparticles at the air-liquid interface of a hydrogen peroxide drop. Their interactions transduce ambient chemical energy into periodic mechanical motion and on-board electrical currents. Surprisingly, these oscillations persist at larger ensemble sizes only when a particle with modified reactivity is added to intentionally break permutation symmetry. We explain such emergent order through the discovery of a thermodynamic mechanism for asymmetry-induced order. The on-board power harvested from the stabilised oscillations enables the use of electronic components, which we demonstrate by cyclically and synchronously driving a microrobotic arm. This work highlights a new strategy for achieving low-frequency oscillations at the microscale, paving the way for future microrobotic autonomy.},

Herein, we developed a new strategy for nanoengineering macromolecular drugs by an elaborate peptide, termed PSP (VVVVVHHRGDC), capable of directly conjugating with cargo to be a PSP-cargo monomer as building block tending to self-assemble into a well-defined nanoshell with tumor-triggered shape and charge switch. As a proof of concept, conjugation PSP to a D-peptide activator of tumor suppressor p53 termed DPMI (1492.5 Da) generated hollow spheres ∼80 nm in diameter named PSP-DPMI that disintegrated only in the acidic microenvironment of tumor tissues, followed by integrin-mediated cellular uptake of PSP-DPMI monomers. Importantly, PSP-based self-assembly successfully endowed the DPMI with long circulation time and high cancer-cell-specific intracellular accumulation. PSP-DPMI nanoshells potently inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in vivo by the p53 restoration, while maintaining a highly favorable in vivo safety profile. Out of conventional encapsulation and conjugation, our study showcases a clinically viable novel method to nanoengineer macromolecular agents such as peptide for anticancer therapy and provides a hazard-free alternative strategy for the theranostics delivery.},

	abstract = {Physical systems exhibiting neuromechanical functions promise to enable structures with directly encoded autonomy and intelligence. A neuromorphic metamaterials class embodying bioinspired mechanosensing, memory, and learning functionalities obtained by leveraging mechanical instabilities integrated with memristive materials is reported. The prototype system comprises a multistable metamaterial whose bistable dome‐shaped units collectively filter, amplify, and transduce external mechanical inputs over large areas into simple electrical signals using embedded piezoresistive sensors. Dome deformations in nonvolatile memristors triggered by the transduced signals, providing a means to store loading events in measurable material states are recorded. Sequentially applied mechanical inputs result in accumulated memristance changes that allow us to physically encode a Hopfield network into the neuromorphic metamaterials. This physical network learns the history of spatially distributed input patterns. Crucially, the neuromorphic metamaterials can retrieve the learned patterns from the memristors’ final accumulated state. Therefore, the system exhibits the ability to learn without supervised training and retain spatially distributed inputs with minimal external overhead. The system's embodied mechanosensing, memory, and learning capabilities establish an avenue for synthetic neuromorphic metamaterials that learn via tactile interactions. This capability suggests new types of large‐area smart surfaces for robotics, autonomous systems, wearables, and morphing structures subjected to spatiotemporal mechanical loading.},

However, this is usually difficult because of their unfavorably high-energy states. Here, a simple but general pathway for topology engineering is presented: processing topological defects and shape large-scale patterns in materials with liquid crystalline nature. Dragging field is created through flowing materials at liquid–liquid crystal phase transition temperature or designing electric-field driven temperature gradient. The dragging fields coupled to a dense colony of topological defects with random spatial distribution form nontrivial periodic ordered topological patterns that are energetically unfavorable compared to the uniform ground state, but are stable in the stationary state. Topological polymeric films based on the strategy are also fabricated. The dragging speed and surface interactions are found to be dominant factors in generating and stabilizing the patterns. This strategy endows fluids with regular and large-scale topological patterns, paving a new way for the development of fluids and gels with spatially modulated topological nature.},

In this system, nanoparticles on a lipid chip function as the hardware that features memory, processors, and output units, and DNA strands are used as the software to provide molecular instructions for the facile programming of logic circuits.

            The development of memory devices with functions that simultaneously process and store data is required for efficient computation. To achieve this, artificial synaptic devices have been proposed because they can construct hybrid networks with biological neurons and perform neuromorphic computation. However, irreversible aging of these electrical devices causes unavoidable performance degradation. Although several photonic approaches to controlling currents have been suggested, suppression of current levels and switching of analog conductance in a simple photonic manner remain challenging. Here, we demonstrated a nanograin network memory using reconfigurable percolation paths in a single Si nanowire with solid core/porous shell and pure solid core segments. The electrical and photonic control of current percolation paths enabled the analog and reversible adjustment of the persistent current level, exhibiting memory behavior and current suppression in this single nanowire device. In addition, the synaptic behaviors of memory and erasure were demonstrated through potentiation and habituation processes. Photonic habituation was achieved using laser illumination on the porous nanowire shell, with a linear decrease in the postsynaptic current. Furthermore, synaptic elimination was emulated using two adjacent devices interconnected on a single nanowire. Therefore, electrical and photonic reconfiguration of the conductive paths in Si nanograin networks will pave the way for next-generation nanodevice technologies.},

	abstract = {Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.},

Time-dependent magnetic fields are treated as convenient energy inputs to construct such a dynamic self-assembled system. The induced interactions can be further tuned by modulating the input field, resulting in a diversity of assembled patterns. However, formation of a functional dynamic pattern with controllability remains a challenge. Herein, we report the formation and pattern control of dynamically self-assembled magnetic droplets at an air–liquid interface, energized by a precessing magnetic field. The formation process involves the assembly of magnetic microparticles into particle chains inside droplets, and then highly ordered patterns are generated by balancing the induced interactions among droplets. By modulating the input field, the interactions and collective behaviors are adjusted and the pattern can be reversibly tuned, i.e., expand and shrink, in a controlled manner. Furthermore, the assembled droplets are able to be steered in two-dimensional as an entity by applying a magnetic field gradient. Utilizing dynamic pattern control and steerability of the assembled structure, cargoes are successfully trapped, transported, and released in a noncontact fashion, indicating that the dynamically assembled droplets can act as a reconfigurable untethered robotic end-effector for manipulation.},

Systematic investigation of the colloidal trajectories reveals that in acidic environments the propulsion velocity reduces dramatically due to colloid swelling. This leads to a chemotaxis-like accumulation for ensembles of these responsive particles in low-pH regions. In synergy with this chemically defined accumulation, the colloids also show an enhancement in the release rate of an encapsulated cargo molecule. Together, these effects result in a strategy to harness catalytic propulsion for combined autonomous transport and cargo release directed by a chemical stimulus, displaying a greater than 30 times local cargo-accumulation enhancement. Lactic acid can be used as the stimulus for this behavior, an acid produced by some tumors, suggesting possible eventual utility as a drug-delivery method.

	abstract = {Humankind has been obsessed with knots in religion, culture and daily life for millennia, while physicists like Gauss, Kelvin and Maxwell already involved them in models centuries ago. Nowadays, colloidal particles can be fabricated to have shapes of knots and links with arbitrary complexity. In liquid crystals, closed loops of singular vortex lines can be knotted by using colloidal particles and laser tweezers, as well as by confining nematic fluids into micrometer-sized droplets with complex topology. Knotted and linked colloidal particles induce knots and links of singular defects, which can be interlinked (or not) with colloidal particle knots, revealing the diversity of interactions between topologies of knotted fields and topologically nontrivial surfaces of colloidal objects. Even more diverse knotted structures emerge in nonsingular molecular alignment and magnetization fields in liquid crystals and colloidal ferromagnets. The topological solitons include hopfions, skyrmions, heliknotons, torons and other spatially localized continuous structures, which are classified based on homotopy theory, characterized by integer-valued topological invariants and often contain knotted or linked preimages, nonsingular regions of space corresponding to single points of the order parameter space. A zoo of topological solitons in liquid crystals, colloids and ferromagnets promises new breeds of information displays and a plethora of data storage, electro-optic and photonic applications. Their particle-like collective dynamics echoes coherent motions in active matter, ranging from crowds of people to schools of fish. This review discusses the state of the art in the field, as well as highlights recent developments and open questions in physics of knotted soft matter. We systematically overview knotted field configurations, the allowed transformations between them, their physical stability and how one can use one form of knotted fields to model, create and imprint other forms. The large variety of symmetries accessible to liquid crystals and colloids offer insights into stability, transformation and emergent dynamics of fully nonsingular and singular knotted fields of fundamental and applied importance. The common thread of this review is the ability to experimentally visualize these knots in real space. The review concludes with a discussion of how the studies of knots in liquid crystals and colloids can offer insights into topologically related structures in other branches of physics, with answers to many open questions, as well as how these experimentally observable knots hold a strong potential for providing new inspirations to the mathematical knot theory.},

In addition, as a signal amplification method, the combination of LCs and whispering gallery mode (WGM) optical microcavities can provide higher detection sensitivity due to the extremely high quality factor and the small mode volume of the WGM optical microcavity, which enhances the interaction between the light field and biotargets. In this review, we present an overview of the basic principles, the structure, and the applications of LC biosensors. We discuss the important properties of LC and the principle of LC biosensors. The different geometries of LCs in the biosensing systems as well as their applications in the biological detection are then described. The fabrication and the application of the LC-based WGM microcavity optofluidic sensor in the biological detection are also introduced. Finally, challenges and potential research opportunities in the development of LC-based biosensors are discussed.},

Crystalline materials can readily deform under various stimuli and the extent of recoverable deformation is highly dependent upon bond type1,2,5–10. Indeed, for structures held together via simple electrostatic interactions, minimal deformations are tolerated. By contrast, structures held together by molecular bonds can, in principle, sustain much larger deformations and more easily recover their original configurations. Here we study the deformation properties of well-faceted colloidal crystals engineered with DNA. These crystals are large in size (greater than 100 µm) and have a body-centred cubic (bcc) structure with a high viscoelastic volume fraction (of more than 97\%). Therefore, they can be compressed into irregular shapes with wrinkles and creases, and, notably, these deformed crystals, upon rehydration, assume their initial well-formed crystalline morphology and internal nanoscale order within seconds. For most crystals, such compression and deformation would lead to permanent, irreversible damage. The substantial structural changes to the colloidal crystals are accompanied by notable and reversible optical property changes. For example, whereas the original and structurally recovered crystals exhibit near-perfect (over 98\%) broadband absorption in the ultraviolet–visible region, the deformed crystals exhibit significantly increased reflection (up to 50\% of incident light at certain wavelengths), mainly because of increases in their refractive index and inhomogeneity.},

              Cells continually have to sense their environments to make decisions—to stay put or move, to differentiate or proliferate, or even to live or die. However, they are thwarted by noise at the cellular scale. Cells use signaling networks to filter this noise as much as possible and sense accurately. To operate these networks, resources are required: time, protein copies, and energy. We present a theory for the optimal design of cellular sensing systems that maximize sensing precision given these resources. It reveals a new design principle, namely that of optimal resource allocation. It describes how these resources must be allocated so that none are wasted. We show that the chemotaxis network of
              Escherichia coli
              obeys this principle.

              Living cells deploy many resources to sense their environments, including receptors, downstream signaling molecules, time, and fuel. However, it is not known which resources fundamentally limit the precision of sensing, like weak links in a chain, and which can compensate each other, leading to trade-offs between them. We present a theory for the optimal design of the large class of sensing systems in which a receptor drives a push–pull network. The theory identifies three classes of resources that are required for sensing: receptors and their integration time, readout molecules, and energy (fuel turnover). Each resource class sets a fundamental sensing limit, which means that the sensing precision is bounded by the limiting resource class and cannot be enhanced by increasing another class—the different classes cannot compensate each other. This result yields a previously unidentified design principle, namely that of optimal resource allocation in cellular sensing.

	abstract = {Moving animal groups transmit information through propagating waves or behavioral cascades, exhibiting characteristics akin to systems near a critical point from statistical physics. Using data from freely swimming schooling fish in an experimental tank, we investigate spontaneous behavioral cascades involving turning avalanches, where large directional shifts propagate across the group. We analyze several avalanche metrics and provide a detailed picture of the dynamics associated with turning avalanches, employing tools from avalanche behavior in condensed-matter physics and seismology. Our results identify power-law distributions and robust scale-free behavior through data collapses and scaling relationships, confirming a necessary condition for criticality in fish schools. We explore the biological function of turning avalanches and link them to collective decision-making processes in selecting a new movement direction for the school. We report relevant boundary effects arising from interactions with the tank walls and influential roles of boundary individuals. Finally, spatial and temporal correlations in avalanches are explored using the concept of aftershocks from seismology, revealing clustering of avalanche events below a designated timescale and an Omori law with a faster decay rate than observed in earthquakes.

Here, we introduce a force map technique suitable for the analysis of the alignment forces experienced by individuals. After validating it using an agent-based model, we apply the force map to experimental data of schooling fish. We observe signatures of an effective alignment force with faster neighbors and an unexpected antialignment with slower neighbors. Instead of an explicit antialignment behavior, we suggest that the observed pattern is the result of a selective attention mechanism, where fish pay less attention to slower neighbors. This mechanism implies the existence of temporal leadership interactions based on relative speeds between neighbors. We present support for this hypothesis both from agent-based modeling as well as from exploring leader–follower relationships in the experimental data.},

            Behavioral contagion and the presence of behavioral cascades are natural features in groups of animals showing collective motion, such as schooling fish or grazing herbivores. Here we study empirical behavioral cascades observed in fish schools defined as avalanches of consecutive large changes in the heading direction of the trajectory of fish. In terms of a minimum turning angle introduced to define a large change, avalanches are characterized by distributions of size and duration showing scale-free signatures, reminiscent of self-organized critical behavior. We observe that avalanches are generally triggered by a small number of fish, which act as effective leaders that induce large rearrangements of the group’s trajectory. This observation motivates the proposal of a simple model, based in the classical Vicsek model of collective motion, in which a given individual acts as a leader subject to random heading reorientations. The model reproduces qualitatively the empirical avalanche behavior observed in real schools, and hints towards a connection between effective leadership, long range interactions and avalanche behavior in collective movement.},

I propose that this remarkable changeability of polymer properties can be related to the immense variability of non-equilibrium conformational states, providing polymers with capacities for responding and adapting to changes in environmental conditions and to external stimuli. By decoding the relations between properties and meta-stable conformational states, we may be able to accomplish polymer products with selectable unique properties. In support of this claim, I first present a few typical examples focusing on changes induced by varying drying, freezing, or crystallization procedures, relevant in many industrial processing strategies for polymeric systems. In these examples, deviations from equilibrium conformations are controlled by a preparation parameter and the annealing/aging time and temperature. Subsequently, I briefly discuss the possibilities for a quantitative description of chain conformations deviating from equilibrium, which allow establishing a link between changes on a molecular level and their macroscopic behavior. A comprehensive and systematic investigation of out-of-equilibrium polymer properties will widen the scope of polymer science and enlarge the range of applications of polymers based on their responsiveness and adaptability derived from their memorizing capacities.},

	abstract = {Polymers when confined to a dimension comparable to the length scale of polymer chain coils such as thin films, often lead to molecular relaxation processes distinct from their bulk counterpart. Often observed as thermal and mechanical responses such relaxation has been frequently associated with the squeezing of polymer chains having conformations trapped far from thermodynamic equilibrium and subsequently generating processing-induced molecular recoiling stress. Relaxation in polymer films can be modified by tuning the molecular recoiling stress, which is directly influenced by the preparation conditions of the polymer thin films. Hence a comprehensive understanding of the genesis and relaxation of molecular recoiling stress becomes necessary. Here, we provide insights into the nonequilibrium nature observed in polymer thin films, focusing majorly on the investigations into the molecular recoiling stress using the dewetting technique. The impact of various factors like temperature of dewetting, thickness of films, molecular weight of polymers, and physical aging affecting the relaxation of molecular recoiling stress is discussed. In addition, discussions on the possible mechanisms of relaxation and modification of molecular recoiling stress by varying the spin-coating speed and addition of plasticizers are also provided. An alternate approach which gives a new perspective into the relaxation of molecular recoiling stress considering the entropy generated during the dewetting of polymer films is also included. The present work is expected to give the reader a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of molecular recoiling stress relaxation occurring in polymer thin films.},

Elucidating physico-chemical constraints for global minimization of dissipation and error is important for understanding enzyme evolution. Here, we identify theoretically a fundamental error–cost bound that tightly constrains the performance of proofreading networks under any parameter variations preserving the rate discrimination between substrates. The bound is kinetically controlled, i.e. completely determined by the difference between the transition state energies on the underlying free energy landscape. The importance of the bound is analysed for three biological processes. DNA replication by T7 DNA polymerase is shown to be nearly optimized, i.e. its kinetic parameters place it in the immediate proximity of the error–cost bound. The isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) of E. coli also operates close to the bound, but further optimization is prevented by the need for reaction speed. In contrast, E. coli ribosome operates in a high-dissipation regime, potentially in order to speed up protein production. Together, these findings establish a fundamental error–dissipation relation in biological proofreading networks and provide a theoretical framework for studying error–dissipation trade-off in other systems with biological discrimination.},

This can cause undesired consequences in copying information since thermal noise can lead to errors that can compromise the functionality of the copy. For example, a high error rate during DNA duplication can lead to cell death. Given the importance of accurate copying at the molecular scale, it is fundamental to understand its thermodynamic features. In this paper, we derive a universal expression for the copy error as a function of entropy production and work dissipated by the system during wrong incorporations. Its derivation is based on the second law of thermodynamics; hence, its validity is independent of the details of the molecular machinery, be it any polymerase or artificial copying device. Using this expression, we find that information can be copied in three different regimes. In two of them, work is dissipated to either increase or decrease the error. In the third regime, the protocol extracts work while correcting errors, reminiscent of a Maxwell demon. As a case study, we apply our framework to study a copy protocol assisted by kinetic proofreading, and show that it can operate in any of these three regimes. We finally show that, for any effective proofreading scheme, error reduction is limited by the chemical driving of the proofreading reaction.},

There is considerable interest in creating autonomous materials systems endowed with the capability to make decisions. In this work, we introduce the concept of using topological defects in active matter to perform logic operations. When an extensile active stress in a nematic liquid crystal is turned on, +1/2 defects can self-propel, in analogy to electron transport under a voltage gradient. By relying on hydrodynamic simulations of active nematics, we demonstrate that patterns of activity, when combined with surfaces imparting certain orientations, can be used to control the formation and transport of +1/2 defects. We further show that asymmetric high- and low-activity patterns can be used to create effective defect gates, tunnels, and amplifiers. The proposed active systems offer the potential to perform computations and transmit information in active soft materials, including actin-, tubulin-, and cell-based systems.

	abstract = {Animal morphogenesis arises from the complex interplay between multiple mechanical and biochemical processes with mutual feedback. Developing an effective, coarse-grained description of morphogenesis is essential for understanding how these processes are coordinated across scales to form robust, functional outcomes. Here we show that the nematic order of the supracellular actin fibres in regenerating Hydra defines a slowly varying field, whose dynamics provide an effective description of the morphogenesis process. We show that topological defects in this field, which are long-lived yet display rich dynamics, act as organization centres with morphological features developing at defect sites. These observations suggest that the nematic orientation field can be considered a ‘mechanical morphogen’ whose dynamics, in conjugation with various biochemical and mechanical signalling processes, result in the robust emergence of functional patterns during morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {In the realm of particle self-assembly, it is possible to reliably construct nearly arbitrary structures if all the pieces are distinct1–3, but systems with fewer flavours of building blocks have so far been limited to the assembly of exotic crystals4–6. Here we introduce a minimal model system of colloidal droplet chains7, with programmable DNA interactions that guide their downhill folding into specific geometries. Droplets are observed in real space and time, unravelling the rules of folding. Combining experiments, simulations and theory, we show that controlling the order in which interactions are switched on directs folding into unique structures, which we call colloidal foldamers8. The simplest alternating sequences (ABAB...) of up to 13 droplets yield 11 foldamers in two dimensions and one in three dimensions. Optimizing the droplet sequence and adding an extra flavour uniquely encodes more than half of the 619 possible two-dimensional geometries. Foldamers consisting of at least 13 droplets exhibit open structures with holes, offering porous design. Numerical simulations show that foldamers can further interact to make complex supracolloidal architectures, such as dimers, ribbons and mosaics. Our results are independent of the dynamics and therefore apply to polymeric materials with hierarchical interactions on all length scales, from organic molecules all the way to Rubik’s Snakes. This toolbox enables the encoding of large-scale design into sequences of short polymers, placing folding at the forefront of materials self-assembly.},

Ubiquitous in nature and across length scales, such phenomena are also amenable to artificial settings, e.g., where brainless self-propelled robots orchestrate their movements into spatio-temportal patterns via the application of external cues or when confined within flexible boundaries. Very much like their natural counterparts, these approaches typically require many units to initiate collective motion such that controlling the ensuing dynamics is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel yet simple mechanism that leverages nonlinear elasticity to tame near-diffusive motile particles in forming structures capable of directed motion and other emergent intelligent behaviors. Our elasto-active system comprises two centimeter-sized self-propelled microbots connected with elastic beams. These microbots exert forces that suffice to buckle the beam and set the structure in motion. We first rationalize the physics of the interaction between the beam and the microbots. Then we use reduced order models to predict the interactions of our elasto-active structure with boundaries, e.g., walls and constrictions, and demonstrate how they can exhibit intelligent behaviors such as maze navigation. The findings are relevant to designing intelligent materials or soft robots capable of autonomous space exploration, adaptation, and interaction with the surrounding environment.},

The proposed structure represents a promising route for the realization of a broadband, compact, and active platform for future optoelectronic devices including multiband bio/chemical and light sensors.},

The shape of the resonating body has been numerically derived and consists of seven star-polygons that form a fractal structure. The actual resonator is defined by focused ion-beam implantation on a SOI wafer where its 18 vertices are clamped to nanopillars. The structure is suspended over a 10 μm trench and has width of 12 μm. Its thickness of 0.040 μm is defined by the fabrication process and prescribes Young’s modulus of 76 GPa which is significantly lower than the value of the bulk material. The resonator is excited by the bottom Si-layer and the interferometric characterisation confirms broadband frequency response with quality factors of over 800 for several peaks between 2 MHz and 16 MHz. COMSOL FEM software has been used to vary material properties and residual stress in order to fit the eigenfrequencies of the model with the resonance peaks detected experimentally. Further use of the model shows how the symmetry of the device affects the frequency spectrum. Also, by using the FEM model, the possibility for an electrical read out of the device was tested. The experimental measurements and simulations proved that the device can resonate at many different excitation frequencies allowing multiple operational bands. The size, and the power needed for actuation are comparable with the ones of single beam resonator while the fractal structure allows much larger area for functionalisation.},

            Life provides the best demonstration of complex and adaptive nonequilibrium system, which executes biological functions through nonequilibrium structure transformation. Creating lifelike materials to achieve part of or full biological functions is a grand challenge. Traditional memories from hard and dry materials are static, with no ability of forgetting; here we propose to use soft and wet hydrogels to achieve dynamic memories with spontaneous but learning-strength-dependent forgetting ability by using nonequilibrium structure transformation, in analogy to the human brain. We believe the concept of dynamic memorizing–forgetting behavior proposed here inspires further research on developing lifelike materials based on the nonequilibrium process of soft matter.
          , 
            The memory of our brain, stored in soft matter, is dynamic, and it forgets spontaneously to filter unimportant information. By contrast, the existing manmade memory, made from hard materials, is static, and it does not forget without external stimuli. Here we propose a principle for developing dynamic memory from soft hydrogels with temperature-sensitive dynamic bonds. The memorizing–forgetting behavior is achieved based on fast water uptake and slow water release upon thermal stimulus, as well as thermal-history-dependent transparency change of these gels. The forgetting time is proportional to the thermal learning time, in analogy to the behavior of brain. The memory is stable against temperature fluctuation and large stretching; moreover, the forgetting process is programmable. This principle may inspire future research on dynamic memory based on the nonequilibrium process of soft matter.},

Artificial aqueous ion channels are emerging as an exciting platform for neuromorphic computing, representing a departure from conventional solid-state devices by directly mimicking the brain’s fluidic ion transport. Supported by a quantitative theoretical model, we present easy-to-fabricate tapered microchannels that embed a conducting network of fluidic nanochannels between a colloidal structure. Due to transient salt concentration polarization, our devices are volatile memristors (memory resistors) that are remarkably stable. The voltage-driven net salt flux and accumulation, that underpin the concentration polarization, surprisingly combine into a diffusionlike quadratic dependence of the memory retention time on the channel length, allowing channel design for a specific timescale. We implement our device as a synaptic element for neuromorphic reservoir computing. Individual channels distinguish various time series, that together represent (handwritten) numbers, for subsequent in silico classification with a simple readout function. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing the promise of fluidic ion channels as a platform to emulate the rich aqueous dynamics of the brain.},

We extract multiple distinct chemically regulated synaptic features from a single conical microfluidic channel carrying functionalized surface groups, using finite-element calculations of continuum transport equations.

By modeling a Langmuir-type surface reaction on the channel wall we couple fast voltage-induced volumetric salt accumulation with a long-term channel surface charge modulation by means of fast charging and slow discharging. These nonlinear charging dynamics are understood through an analytic approximation rooted in first-principles. We show how short-and long-term potentiation and depression, frequency-dependent plasticity, and chemical-electrical signal coincidence detection (acting like a chemical-electrical AND logic gate), akin to the NMDA mechanism for Hebbian learning in biological synapses, can all be emulated with a single channel.},

Here, we merge two subgroups of fish with different levels of perceived risk, manipulated through habituation to the experimental arena, and quantitatively analyze their movement. Fish with heightened risk perception tend to occupy more central positions within the group, consistent with the selfish herd hypothesis. This behavior appears to be driven by adjusted local interactions with nearby individuals. Compared to more habituated fish, these individuals also exhibit greater coordination, shorter burst-and-coast dynamics, more efficient information transmission, and a stronger tendency to adopt follower roles. To validate the findings, we develop a machine learning tool that successfully classifies the subgroup identity of individual fish. Our study demonstrates how differences in local-scale inter-individual interactions can drive spatial assortment within groups, based on heterogeneity in the perception of risk.},

              Artificial microswimmers, i.e. colloidal scale objects capable of self-propulsion, have garnered significant attention due to their central role as models for out of equilibrium systems. Moreover, their potential applications in diverse fields such as biomedicine, environmental remediation, and materials science have long been hypothesized, often in conjunction with their ability to deliver cargoes to overcome mass transport limitations. A very efficient way to load molecular cargoes is to disperse them in a liquid compartment, however, fabricating microswimmers with multiple liquid compartments remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we present a modular fabrication platform that combines microfluidic synthesis and sequential capillarity-assisted particle assembly (sCAPA) for microswimmers with various liquid compartments. We demonstrate the synthesis of monodisperse, small polymer-based microcapsules (Ø = 3–6
              μ
              m) with different liquid cargoes using a flow-focusing microfluidic device. By employing the sCAPA technique, we assemble multiple microcapsules into microswimmers with high precision, resulting in versatile microswimmers with multiple liquid compartments and programmable functionalities. Our work provides a flexible approach for the fabrication of modular microswimmers, which could potentially actively transport cargoes and release them on demand in the future.},

            The assembly of nanomaterials into suprastructures offers the possibility to fabricate larger scale functional materials, whose inner structure strongly influences their functionality for a vast range of applications. In spite of the many current strategies, achieving multi-compartment structures in a targeted and versatile way remains highly challenging. Here, we describe a controllable and straightforward route to create uniform suprastructured materials with a multi-compartmentalized architecture by confining primary nanocapsules into droplets using a cross-junction microfluidic device. Following solvent evaporation from the droplets, the nanocapsules spontaneously assemble into precisely sized multi-compartment particles, which we term supracapsules. Thanks to the process, each spatially separated nanocapsule unit retains its cargo and functionalities within the resulting supracapsules. However, new collective properties emerge, and, particularly, programmable release profiles that are distinct from those of single-compartment capsules. Finally, the suprastructures can be disassembled into single-compartment units by applying ultra-sonication, switching their release to a burst-release mode. These findings open up exciting opportunities to fabricate multi-compartment suprastructures incorporating diverse functionalities for materials with emerging properties.},

            Self‐reporting materials have emerged as a promising tool for real‐time monitoring of stress and damage in structural materials. When critical stress is applied to these materials, an optical response is triggered – for example by dye release, or molecular cleavage. A key challenge is to extend these systems to respond to multiple different stress levels. To achieve this, a novel microcapsule‐based assembly strategy is presented. Microfluidic synthesis is used to create microcapsules that release dye at a precise level of applied force. Subsequently, capillary assembly is used to combine microcapsules with different stress‐responsiveness and different fluorescent dyes into chains, which are uniformly patterned into regular arrays, and embed these into the self‐reporting materials. Through indentation experiments, it is shown that these materials can distinguish and record spatially resolved local stresses based on the fluorescence emitted upon microcapsule rupture. Crucially, the technique's accuracy is significantly improved when microcapsules are spatially organized within the material. This versatile technique can be applied to a range of different materials, via the use of thin coatings containing the regularly patterned microcapsule chains.},

Biological information, such has genetic information stored in DNA sequences, has semantic content. It carries meaning that is defined by the molecular context of its cellular environment. Information processing in biological systems displays an inherent reflexivity, a tendency for the computational information-processing to be “about” the behaviour of the molecules that participate in the computational process. This is most evident in the operation of the genetic code, where the specificity of the reactions catalysed by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) enzymes is required to be self-sustaining. A cell’s suite of aaRS enzymes completes a reflexively autocatalytic set of molecular components capable of making themselves through the operation of the code. This set requires the existence of a body of reflexive information to be stored in an organism’s genome. The genetic code is a reflexively self-organised mapping of the chemical properties of amino acid sidechains onto codon “tokens”. It is a highly evolved symbolic system of chemical self-description. Although molecular biological coding is generally portrayed in terms of classical bit-transfer events, various biochemical events explicitly require quantum coherence for their occurrence. Whether the implicit transfer of quantum information, qbits, is indicative of wide-ranging quantum computation in living systems is currently the subject of extensive investigation and speculation in the field of Quantum Biology.},

            Self‐reporting polymers, which can indicate damage or exposure to excessive stress with a clearly perceptible optical signal, are potentially useful for several technological applications, including stress‐sensitive sensors that enable in situ monitoring of mechanical events and structural health monitoring systems. A versatile and simple concept to realize this function is the exploitation of microcapsules that are filled with solutions of dyes that are released and chemically or physically activated when the protective shell is damaged. Such microcapsules can readily be incorporated into polymers and the composites thus made can be processed into films, coatings, or other objects. Mechanochromic effects can be realized with different types of dyes and activation schemes. In this concept article, a selection of recent key studies is presented to provide an overview of the state of the field. Different architectures and operating principles and their advantages and drawbacks are reviewed. The parameters that influence the design of microcapsule‐based mechanochromic systems are considered and unexplored chromophore systems that might be useful to design future self‐reporting polymers are discussed. Finally, specific aspects of capsule design, fabrication, and integration into polymers are presented. Throughout the article, challenges and opportunities of the concept are highlighted and possible future directions are discussed.},

Herein, we equipped coatings with nanocapsules that can self-indicate their mechanical micro-damage via color development. Hence, whenever the coating was damaged, the capsules broke and highlighted the damaged spot. As a second feature, the color development was reversed and discoloration occurred in the presence of (self-)healing compounds, allowing the user to monitor the healing process. Thus, in the first step, damages were highlighted via color “turn-on” and in the subsequent step a propagating healing reaction “turns-off” the damage indication system to trace the healing reaction and allow monitoring of the entire health cycle.},

	abstract = {ConspectusThe development of effective autonomous micro- and nanomotors relies on controlling fluid motion at interfaces. One of the main challenges in the engineering of such artificial machines is the quest for efficient mechanisms to power them without using external driving forces. In the past decade, there has been an important increase of man-made micro- and nanomotors fueled by self-generated physicochemical gradients. Impressive proofs of concept of multitasking machines have been reported demonstrating their capabilities for a plethora of applications. While the progress toward applications is promising, there are still open questions on fundamental physicochemical aspects behind the mechanical actuation, which require more experimental and theoretical efforts. These efforts are not merely academic but will open the door for an efficient and practical implementation of such promising devices.In this Account, we focus on chemically driven motors whose motion is the result of a complex interplay of chemical reactions and (electro)hydrodynamic phenomena. A reliable study of these processes is rather difficult with mobile objects like swimming motors. However, pumps, which are the immobilized motor counterparts, emerge as simple manufacturing and well-defined platforms for a better experimental probing of the mechanisms and key parameters controlling the actuation.Here we review some recent studies using a new methodology that has turned out to be very helpful to characterize micropump chemomechanics. The aim was to identify the redox role of the motor components, to map the chemical reaction, and to quantify the relevant electrokinetic parameters (e.g., electric field and fluid flow). This was achieved by monitoring the velocity of differently charged tracers and by fluorescence imaging of the chemical species involved in the chemical reaction, for example, proton gradients. We applied these techniques to different systems of interest. First, we probed bimetallic pumps as counterparts of the pioneering bimetallic swimmers. We corroborated that fluid motion was due to a self-generated electro-osmotic mechanism driven by the redox decomposition of H2O2. In addition, we analyzed by simulations the key parameters that yield an optimized operation. Moreover, we accomplished a better assessment of the importance of surface chemistry on the metal electrochemical response, highlighting its relevance in controlling the redox role of the metals and motion direction.Second, we focused on metallic and semiconductor micropumps to analyze light-controlled motion mechanisms through photoelectrochemical decomposition of fuels. These pumps were driven by visible light and could operate using just water as fuel. In these systems, we found a very interesting competition between two different mechanisms for fluid propulsion, namely, light-activated electro-osmosis and light-insensitive diffusio-osmosis, stemming from different chemical pathways in the fuel decomposition. In this case, surface roughness becomes a pivotal parameter to enhance or depress one mechanism over the other.These examples demonstrate that pumps are practical platforms to explore operating mechanisms and to quantify their performance. Additionally, they are suitable systems to test novel fuels or motor materials. This knowledge is extensible to swimmers providing not only fundamental understanding of their locomotion mechanisms but also useful clues for their design and optimization.},

The complexity and elegance of solving this problem rely on two key abilities of scout honeybees: self-discovery and imitation, symbolizing independence and interdependence, respectively. We employ a mathematical model to represent this nest-site selection problem and program our kilobots to follow its rules. Our experiments demonstrate that the kilobot swarm can collectively reach consensus decisions in a decentralized manner, akin to honeybees. However, the strength of this consensus depends not only on the interplay between independence and interdependence but also on critical factors such as swarm density and the motion of kilobots. These factors enable the formation of a percolated communication network, through which each robot can receive information beyond its immediate vicinity. By shedding light on this crucial layer of complexity—the crowding and mobility conditions during the decision making—we emphasize the significance of factors typically overlooked but essential to living systems and life itself.},

These channels hence have a memory and are promising elements in brain-inspired (iontronic) circuits. We show here that the memory of such channels stems from transient concentration polarization over the ionic diffusion time. We derive an analytic approximation for these dynamics which shows good agreement with full finite-element calculations. Using our analytic approximation, we propose an experimentally realizable Hodgkin-Huxley iontronic circuit where micrometer cones take on the role of sodium and potassium channels. Our proposed circuit exhibits key features of neuronal communication such as all-or-none action potentials upon a pulse stimulus and a spike train upon a sustained stimulus.},

	abstract = {Networks of tryptophan (Trp)─an aromatic amino acid with strong fluorescence response─are ubiquitous in biological systems, forming diverse architectures in transmembrane proteins, cytoskeletal filaments, subneuronal elements, photoreceptor complexes, virion capsids, and other cellular structures. We analyze the cooperative effects induced by ultraviolet (UV) excitation of several biologically relevant Trp mega-networks, thus giving insights into novel mechanisms for cellular signaling and control. Our theoretical analysis in the single-excitation manifold predicts the formation of strongly superradiant states due to collective interactions among organized arrangements of up to {\textgreater}105 Trp UV-excited transition dipoles in microtubule architectures, which leads to an enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield (QY) that is confirmed by our experiments. We demonstrate the observed consequences of this superradiant behavior in the fluorescence QY for hierarchically organized tubulin structures, which increases in different geometric regimes at thermal equilibrium before saturation, highlighting the effect’s persistence in the presence of disorder. Our work thus showcases the many orders of magnitude across which the brightest (hundreds of femtoseconds) and darkest (tens of seconds) states can coexist in these Trp lattices.},

Several designs in the recent past are capable of emulating large scale networks but avoid complexity in network dynamics by minimizing the number of dynamic variables that are supported and tunable in hardware. We believe that this is due to the lack of a clear understanding of how to design self-tuning complex systems. It has been widely demonstrated that criticality appears to be the default state of the brain and manifests in the form of spontaneous scale-invariant cascades of neural activity. Experiment, theory and recent models have shown that neuronal networks at criticality demonstrate optimal information transfer, learning and information processing capabilities that affect behavior. In this perspective article, we argue that understanding how large scale neuromorphic electronics can be designed to enable emergent adaptive behavior will require an understanding of how networks emulated by such hardware can self-tune local parameters to maintain criticality as a set-point. We believe that such capability will enable the design of truly scalable intelligent systems using neuromorphic hardware that embrace complexity in network dynamics rather than avoiding it.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A feed-forward three-layered model, with an encoding input layer, a wave layer, and a decoding readout, behaves as a conventional neural network in approximating mathematical functions, real-world datasets, and universal Boolean gates. The rank of the transmission matrix has a fundamental role in assessing the learning abilities of the wave. For a given set of training points, a threshold nonlinearity for universal interpolation exists. When considering the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the use of highly nonlinear regimes implies that solitons, rogue, and shock waves do have a leading role in training and computing. Our results may enable the realization of novel machine learning devices by using diverse physical systems, as nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics, polaritonics, and Bose-Einstein condensates. The application of these concepts to photonics opens the way to a large class of accelerators and new computational paradigms.

We tested this principle in a real system of active particles whose motilities are controlled by an external feedback loop. For narrow fields of view, individuals gathered into cohesive nonpolarized groups without requiring active reorientations. For wider fields of view, cohesion could be achieved by lowering the response threshold. We expect this motility-induced cohesion mechanism to be relevant not only for the self-organization of living systems, but also for the design of robust and scalable autonomous systems.},

Interference between waves allows non-linear parallel computation upon simultaneous sensory inputs. Temporal patterns of stimulation are converted to spatial patterns of water waves upon which a linear discrimination can be made. Whereas Wolfgang Maass’ Liquid State Machine requires fine tuning of the spiking neural network parameters, water has inherent self-organising properties such as strong local interactions, time-dependent spread of activation to distant areas, inherent stability to a wide variety of inputs, and high complexity. Water achieves this “for free”, and does so without the time-consuming computation required by realistic neural models. An analogy is made between water molecules and neurons in a recurrent neural network.},

Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.},

These Nafion micromotors are made using colloidal lithography by micro/nanostructuring Nafion in the form of asymmetric rods. These microswimmers exhibit fascinating collective motion in water driven by the interplay of their self-generated chemical/electric fields and their capability to pump matter nearby towards the collective motile structure. The pumping activity of the microswimmers induces the formation of growing mobile clusters, whose velocity increases with size. Such dynamic structures are able to trap nearby micro/nano-objects while purifying the liquid, which acts both as the transport media and as fuel.

However, many of these systems are activated by nocuous chemical fuels, cannot operate at high salt concentrations, or have difficulty for controlling flow directionality. In this work we report on a self-driven polymer micropump fueled by salt which can trigger both radial and unidirectional fluid flows. The micropump is based on the cation-exchanger Nafion, which produces chemical gradients and local electric fields capable to trigger interfacial electroosmotic flows. Unidirectional pumping is predicted by simulations and achieved experimentally by nanostructuring Nafion into microarrays with a fine tune modulation of surrounding surface zeta potentials. Nafion micropumps work in a wide range of salt concentrations, are reusable, and can be fueled by different salt cations. We demonstrate that they work with the common water-contaminant cadmium, using the own capture of this ion as fuel to drive fluid pumping. Thus, this system has potential for efficient and fast water purification strategies for environmental remediation. Unidirectional Nafion pumps also hold promise for effective analyte delivery or preconcentration for (bio)sensing assays.},

The mechanism of formation of this EZ has been the subject of a controversial and long-standing debate. Previous studies by Schurr et al. and Florea et al. root the explanation of this phenomenon in the ion-exchange properties of Nafion, which generates ion diffusion and ion gradients that drive the repulsion of solutes by diffusiophoresis. Here we have evaluated separately the electrophoretic and chemiphoretic contributions to multi-ionic diffusiophoresis using differently charged colloidal tracers as solutes to identify better their contribution in the EZ formation. Our experimental results, which are also supported by numerical simulations, show that the electric field, built up due to the unequal diffusion coefficients of the exchanged ions, is the dominant parameter behind such interfacial phenomenon in the presence of alkali metal chlorides. The EZ formation depends on the interplay of the electric field with the zeta potential of the solute and can be additionally modulated by changing ion diffusion coefficients or adding salts. As a consequence, we show that not all solutes can be expelled from the Nafion interface and hence the EZ is not always formed. This study thus provides a more detailed description of the origin and dynamics of this phenomenon and opens the door to the rational use of this active interface for many potential applications.},

We focused on spontaneous mode switching and collective behavior of droplets as emergent properties of the system. Droplets demonstrated spontaneous mode switching by changing speed, direction and acceleration over time, and collective behaviors of droplets resulted from such autonomous characteristics. In this paper, we quantitatively measured those characteristics to show that droplets did not act completely independently in the same system, but tend to be attracted to one another and interact with each other by adjusting their motion.},

Here we have explored the possibility that fatty acid systems also demonstrate movement. An oil phase was loaded with a fatty acid anhydride precursor and introduced to an aqueous fatty acid micelle solution. The oil droplets showed autonomous, sustained movement through the aqueous media. Internal convection created a positive feedback loop, and the movement of the oil droplet was sustained as convection drove fresh precursor to the surface to become hydrolyzed. As the system progressed, more surfactant was produced and some of the oil droplets transformed into supramolecular aggregates resembling multilamellar vesicles. The oil droplets also moved directionally within chemical gradients and exhibited a type of chemotaxis.},

A chemical reaction within the oil droplet induces an instability, the symmetry of the oil droplet breaks, and the droplet begins to move through the aqueous phase. The complement of physical phenomena that is then generated indicates the presence of feedback cycles that, as will be argued, form the basis for self-regulation, homeostasis, and perhaps an extended form of autopoiesis.

	abstract = {ConspectusCatalytic Janus colloids produce rapid motion in fluids by decomposing dissolved fuel. There is great potential to exploit these “autonomous chemical swimmers” in applications currently performed by diffusion limited passive colloids. Key application areas for colloids include transporting active ingredients for drug delivery, gathering analytes for medical diagnostics, and self-assembling into regular structures used for photonic materials and lithographic templating. For drug delivery and medical diagnostics, controlling colloidal motion is key in order to target therapies, and transport analytes through lab-on-a-chip devices. Here, the autonomous motion of catalytic Janus colloids can remove the current requirements to induce and control colloid motion using external fields, thereby reducing the technological complexity required for medical therapies and diagnostics. For materials applications exploiting colloidal self-assembly, the additional interactions introduced by catalytic activity and rapid motion are predicted to allow access to new reconfigurable and responsive structures.In order to realize these goals, it is vital to develop methods to control both individual colloidal paths and collective behavior in motile catalytic colloidal systems. However, catalytic Janus colloids’ trajectories are randomized by Brownian effects, and so require new strategies in order to be harnessed for transport. This is achievable using a variety of different approaches. For example, self-assembly and control of catalyst geometry can introduce controlled amounts of rotary motion, or “spin” into chemical swimmer trajectories. Furthermore, rotary motion combined with gravity, produces well-defined orientated helical trajectories. In addition, when catalytic colloids interact with topographical features, such as edges and trenches, they are steered. This gives rise to a new approach for autonomous colloidal microfluidic transport that could be deployed in future lab-on-a-chip devices.Chemical gradients can also influence the motion of catalytic Janus colloids, for example, to cause collective accumulations at specific locations. However, at present, the predicted theoretical degree of control over this phenomenon has not been fully verified in experimental systems. Collective behavior control for chemical swimmers is also possible by exploiting the potential for the complex interactions in these systems to allow access to self-assembled, dynamic and reconfigurable ordered structures. Again, current experiments have not yet accessed the breadth of possible behavior. Consequently, continued efforts are required to understand and control these interaction mechanisms in real world systems. Ultimately, this will help realize the use of catalytic Janus colloids for tasks that require well-controlled motion and structural organization, enabling functions such as analyte capture and concentration, or targeted drug delivery.},

	abstract = {In this study, we demonstrate the use of cyclical low frequency signals with insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) devices for the separation of particles of similar characteristics and an experimental method for estimating particle DEP mobilities. A custom signal designer program was created using Matlab® and COMSOL Multiphysics® for the identification of specific low frequency signals aimed at separating particle mixtures by exploiting slight differences in surface charge (particle zeta potential) or particle size. For the separation by surface charge, a mixture of two types of 10 μm particles was analyzed and effectively separated employing both a custom step signal and a sawtooth left signal. Notably, these particles had the same shape, size, and surface functionalization as well as were made from the same substrate material. For the separation by size, a sample containing 2 μm and 5 μm particles was successfully separated using a custom step signal; these particles had the same shape, surface functionalization, were made from the same substrate materials, and had only a small difference in zeta potential (10 mV). Additionally, an experimental technique was developed to estimate the dielectrophoretic mobility of each particle type; this information was then utilized by the signal designer program. The technique developed in this study is readily applicable for designing signals capable of separating micron-sized particles of similar characteristics, such as microorganisms, where slight differences in cell size and the shape of surface charge could be effectively exploited. These findings open the possibility for applications in microbial screening using iDEP devices.},

This propulsion is studied by moving the micromotors in three-dimensional (3D) space. The micromotors move downwards and upwards at average speeds of 19.1 μm/s and 9.8 μm/s, respectively.

We theoretically prove that the exact gradient can be obtained locally, enabling learning through the immediate vicinity, and we experimentally demonstrate this backpropagation to obtain gradient with high precision. With the gradient information, we showcase the successful training of networks in simulations for behavior learning and machine learning tasks, achieving high accuracy in experiments of regression and classification. Furthermore, we present the retrainability of networks involving task-switching and damage, demonstrating the resilience. Our findings, which integrate the theory for training mechanical neural networks and experimental and numerical validations, pave the way for mechanical machine learning hardware and autonomous self-learning material systems.},

	abstract = {Self-indicating polymers have emerged as a promising class of smart materials that possess the unique ability to undergo detectable variations in their physical or chemical properties in response to various stimuli. This article presents an overview of the most important mechanisms through which these materials exhibit self-indication, including aggregation, phase transition, covalent and non-covalent bond cleavage, isomerization, charge transfer, and energy transfer. Aggregation is a prevalent mechanism observed in self-indicating polymers, where changes in the degree of molecular organization result in variations in optical or electrical properties. Phase transition-induced self-indication relies on the transformation between different phases, such as liquid-to-solid or crystalline-to-amorphous transitions, leading to observable changes in color or conductivity. Covalent bond cleavage-based self-indicating polymers undergo controlled degradation or fragmentation upon exposure to specific triggers, resulting in noticeable variations in their structural or mechanical properties. Isomerization is another crucial mechanism exploited in self-indicating polymers, where the reversible transformation between the different isomeric forms induces detectable changes in fluorescence or absorption spectra. Charge transfer-based self-indicating polymers rely on the modulation of electron or hole transfer within the polymer backbone, manifesting as changes in electrical conductivity or redox properties. Energy transfer is an essential mechanism utilized by certain self-indicating polymers, where energy transfer between chromophores or fluorophores leads to variations in the emission characteristics. Furthermore, this review article highlights the diverse range of applications for self-indicating polymers. These materials find particular use in sensing and monitoring applications, where their responsive nature enables them to act as sensors for specific analytes, environmental parameters, or mechanical stress. Self-indicating polymers have also been used in the development of smart materials, including stimuli-responsive coatings, drug delivery systems, food sensors, wearable devices, and molecular switches. The unique combination of tunable properties and responsiveness makes self-indicating polymers highly promising for future advancements in the fields of biotechnology, materials science, and electronics.},

	abstract = {The concept of memory is traditionally associated with organisms possessing a nervous system. However, even very simple organisms store information about past experiences to thrive in a complex environment—successfully exploiting nutrient sources, avoiding danger, and warding off predators. How can simple organisms encode information about their environment? We here follow how the giant unicellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum responds to a nutrient source. We find that the network-like body plan of the organism itself serves to encode the location of a nutrient source. The organism entirely consists of interlaced tubes of varying diameters. Now, we observe that these tubes grow and shrink in diameter in response to a nutrient source, thereby imprinting the nutrient’s location in the tube diameter hierarchy. Combining theoretical model and experimental data, we reveal how memory is encoded: a nutrient source locally releases a softening agent that gets transported by the cytoplasmic flows within the tubular network. Tubes receiving a lot of softening agent grow in diameter at the expense of other tubes shrinking. Thereby, the tubes’ capacities for flow-based transport get permanently upgraded toward the nutrient location, redirecting future decisions and migration. This demonstrates that nutrient location is stored in and retrieved from the networks’ tube diameter hierarchy. Our findings explain how network-forming organisms like slime molds and fungi thrive in complex environments. We here identify a flow networks’ version of associative memory—very likely of relevance for the plethora of living flow networks as well as for bioinspired design.},

	abstract = {Learning and memory are indisputably key features of animal success. Using information about past experiences is critical for optimal decision-making in a fluctuating environment. Those abilities are usually believed to be limited to organisms with a nervous system, precluding their existence in non-neural organisms. However, recent studies showed that the slime mould Physarum polycephalum, despite being unicellular, displays habituation, a simple form of learning. In this paper, we studied the possible substrate of both short- and long-term habituation in slime moulds. We habituated slime moulds to sodium, a known repellent, using a 6 day training and turned them into a dormant state named sclerotia. Those slime moulds were then revived and tested for habituation. We showed that information acquired during the training was preserved through the dormant stage as slime moulds still showed habituation after a one-month dormancy period. Chemical analyses indicated a continuous uptake of sodium during the process of habituation and showed that sodium was retained throughout the dormant stage. Lastly, we showed that memory inception via constrained absorption of sodium for 2 h elicited habituation. Our results suggest that slime moulds absorbed the repellent and used it as a ‘circulating memory’.

            The geometric reconfigurations in three-dimensional morphable structures have a wide range of applications in flexible electronic devices and smart systems with unusual mechanical, acoustic, and thermal properties. However, achieving the highly controllable anisotropic transformation and dynamic regulation of architected materials crossing different scales remains challenging. Herein, we develop a magnetic regulation approach that provides an enabling technology to achieve the controllable transformation of morphable structures and unveil their dynamic modulation mechanism as well as potential applications. With buckling instability encoded heterogeneous magnetization profiles inside soft architected materials, spatially and temporally programmed magnetic inputs drive the formation of a variety of anisotropic morphological transformations and dynamic geometric reconfiguration. The introduction of magnetic stimulation could help to predetermine the buckling states of soft architected materials, and enable the formation of definite and controllable buckling states without prolonged magnetic stimulation input. The dynamic modulations can be exploited to build systems with switchable fluidic properties and are demonstrated to achieve capabilities of fluidic manipulation, selective particle trapping, sensitivity-enhanced biomedical analysis, and soft robotics. The work provides new insights to harness the programmable and dynamic morphological transformation of soft architected materials and promises benefits in microfluidics, programmable metamaterials, and biomedical applications.},

We consider high-dimensional inverse problems for materials where any particular functionality can be realized by numerous equivalent choices of design parameters. By periodically switching targets in a given design algorithm, we can teach a material to perform incompatible functionalities with minimal changes in design parameters. We exhibit this learning strategy for adaptability in two simulated settings: elastic networks that are designed to switch deformation modes with minimal bond changes and heteropolymers whose folding pathway selections are controlled by a minimal set of monomer affinities. The resulting designs can reveal physical principles, such as nucleation-controlled folding, that enable such adaptability.},

Yet their realization in soft-matter intelligent systems remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a reprogrammable elastic metamaterial that computes matrix-vector multiplications using floppy modes -- deformations with near-zero stored elastic energy. Floppy modes allow us to program complex deformations without being hindered by the natural stiffness of the material; but their practical application is challenging, as their existence depends on global topological properties of the system. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a continuously parameterized unit cell design with well-defined compatibility characteristics. This unit cell is then combined to form arbitrary matrix-vector multiplications that can even be reprogrammed after fabrication. Our results demonstrate that floppy modes can act as key enablers for embodied intelligence, smart MEMS devices and in-sensor edge computing.},

To design the surface features, both two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) finite element based simulations are performed. It is demonstrated that the periodic surface features with controllable morphology, such as one-dimensional waves, checkerboard pattern, and mutually perpendicular apexes, etc., can be realized through varying cavity geometries (e.g., relative intercavity distance, shapes, and biaxial or uniaxial load). Additionally, a simple model for plate buckling is used to elucidate the effect of cavity aspect ratio on the surface pattern. Based on 3D printed prototypes, we further conduct experiments to validate the simulation results of 2D morphologies. The patterned cavities in soft materials make designing a variety of reversible surface features possible, offering an effective fabrication approach for wide application across multiple scales.},

At the same time, modeling of actuator behaviors faces steep challenges, even with available sensor data, due to complex electrical-thermal-mechanical interactions and hysteresis. This article proposes a framework for in-situ sensing and dynamics modeling of actuator states, particularly temperature of SMA wires, which is used to predict robot motions. A planar soft limb is developed, actuated by a pair of SMA coils, that includes compact and robust sensors for temperature and angular deflection. Data from these sensors are used to train a neural network based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to model both unidirectional (single SMA) and bidirectional (both SMAs) motion. Predictions from the model demonstrate that data from the temperature sensor, combined with control inputs, allow for dynamics predictions over extraordinarily long open-loop timescales (10 minutes) with little drift. Prediction errors are on the order of the soft deflection sensor's accuracy. This architecture allows for compact designs of electrothermally-actuated soft robots that include sensing sufficient for motion predictions, helping to bring these robots into practical application.},

	abstract = {The design of complex engineering structures largely relies on computational intelligence in the form of science-based predictive models to support design decisions. This approach requires modeling and manufacturing uncertainties to be accounted for explicitly and leads to an inescapable trade-off of performance for robustness. To remedy this situation, a novel self-design paradigm is proposed that closes the loop between the design and manufacturing processes by leveraging physical intelligence in the form of real-time experimental observations. This allows the real-time product behavior to participate in its own design. The main benefit of the proposed paradigm is that both manufacturing variability and difficult-to-model physics are accounted for implicitly via in situ measurements thus circumventing the performance-robustness trade-off and guaranteeing enhanced performance with respect to standardized designs. This paradigm shift leads to tailored design realizations which could benefit a wide range of high performance engineering applications. The proposed paradigm is applied to the design of a simply-supported plate with a beam-like absorber introduced to reduce vibrations based on an equal peaks performance criteria. The experimental setup includes a low-cost 3D printer driven by a simple decision algorithm and equipped with an online vibration testing system. The performances of a small population of self-designed plates are compared to their standardized counterparts in order to highlight the advantages and limitations of the new self-design manufacturing paradigm.},

	abstract = {Real-world machine learning systems often encounter model performance degradation due to distributional shifts in the underlying data generating process (DGP). Existing approaches to addressing shifts, such as concept drift adaptation, are limited by their reason-agnostic nature. By choosing from a pre-defined set of actions, such methods implicitly assume that the causes of model degradation are irrelevant to what actions should be taken, limiting their ability to select appropriate adaptations. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm to overcome these limitations, called self-healing machine learning (SHML). Contrary to previous approaches, SHML autonomously diagnoses the reason for degradation and proposes diagnosis-based corrective actions. We formalize SHML as an optimization problem over a space of adaptation actions to minimize the expected risk under the shifted DGP. We introduce a theoretical framework for self-healing systems and build an agentic self-healing solution H-LLM which uses large language models to perform self-diagnosis by reasoning about the structure underlying the DGP, and self-adaptation by proposing and evaluating corrective actions. Empirically, we analyze different components of H-LLM to understand why and when it works, demonstrating the potential of self-healing ML.},

This advantage can be attributed principally to the use of elementary physical phenomena as computational primitives, and to the representation of information by the relative values of analog signals rather than by the absolute values of digital signals. This approach requires adaptive techniques to mitigate the effects of component differences. This kind of adaptation leads naturally to systems that learn about their environment. Large-scale adaptive analog systems are more robust to component degradation and failure than are more conventional systems, and they use far less power. For this reason, adaptive analog technology can be expected to utilize the full potential of wafer-scale silicon fabrication.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—one of the most important models for image recognition5—have not yet been fully hardware-implemented using memristor crossbars, which are cross-point arrays with a memristor device at each intersection. Moreover, achieving software-comparable results is highly challenging owing to the poor yield, large variation and other non-ideal characteristics of devices6–9. Here we report the fabrication of high-yield, high-performance and uniform memristor crossbar arrays for the implementation of CNNs, which integrate eight 2,048-cell memristor arrays to improve parallel-computing efficiency. In addition, we propose an effective hybrid-training method to adapt to device imperfections and improve the overall system performance. We built a five-layer memristor-based CNN to perform MNIST10 image recognition, and achieved a high accuracy of more than 96 per cent. In addition to parallel convolutions using different kernels with shared inputs, replication of multiple identical kernels in memristor arrays was demonstrated for processing different inputs in parallel. The memristor-based CNN neuromorphic system has an energy efficiency more than two orders of magnitude greater than that of state-of-the-art graphics-processing units, and is shown to be scalable to larger networks, such as residual neural networks. Our results are expected to enable a viable memristor-based non-von Neumann hardware solution for deep neural networks and edge computing.},

Here we introduce a hybrid in situ–in silico algorithm, called physics-aware training, that applies backpropagation to train controllable physical systems. Just as deep learning realizes computations with deep neural networks made from layers of mathematical functions, our approach allows us to train deep physical neural networks made from layers of controllable physical systems, even when the physical layers lack any mathematical isomorphism to conventional artificial neural network layers. To demonstrate the universality of our approach, we train diverse physical neural networks based on optics, mechanics and electronics to experimentally perform audio and image classification tasks. Physics-aware training combines the scalability of backpropagation with the automatic mitigation of imperfections and noise achievable with in situ algorithms. Physical neural networks have the potential to perform machine learning faster and more energy-efficiently than conventional electronic processors and, more broadly, can endow physical systems with automatically designed physical functionalities, for example, for robotics23–26, materials27–29 and smart sensors30–32.},

	abstract = {Today’s quantum processors composed of fifty or more qubits have allowed us to enter a computational era where the output results are not easily simulatable on the world’s biggest supercomputers. What we have not seen yet, however, is whether or not the complexity achievable with such quantum processors would ever be useful for any practical applications. In the quantum neural network approach, there has been an expectation that the Hilbert space can serve as a computational resource by providing a large feature space; however, it is not understood, nor illustrated in what way the Hilbert space provides that computational power. In this work we introduce a resource-efficient quantum neural network model with a focus on the role of the feature space the quantum processors can give. Then we apply it for classification tasks, showing a quantum advantage in terms of the physical resources needed to realize the neural network. To facilitate the Hilbert space as a large feature space, we utilize scale-free networks that can be generated in a discrete-time crystal model. The virtue of this approach is in both its theoretical simplicity and its practical applicability: our quantum neural network model is simple enough to identify the role of the Hilbert space as the feature space, and, furthermore, can be implemented with current technology. Our model does not require optimization of the quantum processor, and hence once the quantum processor has been set, it can be used for other different classification problems without any changes in the quantum processor itself.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic life contains hierarchical vesicular architectures (i.e. organelles) that are crucial for material production and trafficking, information storage and access, as well as energy production. In order to perform specific tasks, these compartments differ among each other in their membrane composition and their internal cargo and also differ from the cell membrane and the cytosol. Man-made structures that reproduce this nested architecture not only offer a deeper understanding of the functionalities and evolution of organelle-bearing eukaryotic life but also allow the engineering of novel biomimetic technologies. Here, we show the newly developed vesicle-in-water-in-oil emulsion transfer preparation technique to result in giant unilamellar vesicles internally compartmentalized by unilamellar vesicles of different membrane composition and internal cargo, i.e. hierarchical unilamellar vesicles of controlled compositional heterogeneity. The compartmentalized giant unilamellar vesicles were subsequently isolated by a separation step exploiting the heterogeneity of the membrane composition and the encapsulated cargo. Due to the controlled, efficient, and technically straightforward character of the new preparation technique, this study allows the hierarchical fabrication of compartmentalized giant unilamellar vesicles of controlled compositional heterogeneity and will ease the development of eukaryotic cell mimics that resemble their natural templates as well as the fabrication of novel multi-agent drug delivery systems for combination therapies and complex artificial microreactors.},

We show the components of this modular linking system to be stable and to induce sequence-specific aggregation of binary mixtures of emulsion droplets. Three length scales were thereby involved: nanoscale DNA base pairing linking microscopic building blocks resulted in macroscopic aggregates visible to the naked eye. The aggregation process was reversible by changing the temperature and electrolyte concentration and by the addition of competing oligonucleotides. The system was reset and reused by subsequent refunctionalization of the emulsion droplets. DNA-directed self-assembly of oil-in-water emulsion droplets, therefore, offers a solid basis for programmable and recyclable soft materials that undergo structural rearrangements on demand and that range in application from information technology to medicine.},

Chemotaxis, directed motion in response to external gradients, is typically an important process in living systems, but certain artificial systems are also capable of this activity. Previously it was shown that droplet-based chemotactic systems when interfaced with biological systems can act as transporters to move cargo such as hydrogel alginate capsules containing living cells. Here the effectiveness of our system to transport different mammalian cell lines (H460, H1299, A549, HEK293T and HS68) was tested. It was discovered that some lung cancer cell lines release surfactants only when placed in the hydrogel capsules. These surfactants establish the interface between the encapsulated cells and the droplet and also support the chemotaxis of the droplet. Because of this, the droplet-mediated transport system is selective for living cells that produce biosurfactants. This is an example of how the integration of artificial life and biological life could be designed where the systems augment each other and function together as a unit. In this case the living system produces the surfactants that the droplet needs for cargo transport and the artificial system provides the transport for the otherwise sessile mammalian cells. Future applications of droplet-based cell handling that is able to distinguish between cells based not only on viability but cell type, developmental stage or other quantifiable traits are considered.},

Nonlinear anisotropic fluids such as nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) provide untapped opportunities to embed interactions via their topological defects, complex elastic responses, and ability to dramatically restructure in dynamic settings. Here a four-armed ferromagnetic micro-robot is designed and fabricated to embed and dynamically reconfigure information in the nematic director field, generating a suite of physical interactions for cargo manipulation. The micro-robot shape and surface chemistry are designed to generate a nemato-elastic energy landscape in the domain that defines multiple modes of emergent, bottom-up interactions with passive colloids. Micro-robot rotation expands the ability to sculpt interactions; the energy landscape around a rotating micro-robot is dynamically reconfigured by complex far-from-equilibrium dynamics of the micro-robot's companion topological defect. These defect dynamics allow transient information to be programmed into the domain and exploited. Robust micro-robotic manipulation strategies are demonstrated that exploit these diverse modes of nemato-elastic interaction to achieve cargo docking, transport, release, and assembly of complex reconfigurable structures at multi-stable sites. Such structures are of great interest to future developments of LC-based advanced optical device and micro-manufacturing in anisotropic environments.},

          , 
            
              The design of amorphous entangled systems, specifically from soft and active materials, has the potential to open exciting new classes of active, shape-shifting, and task-capable ‘smart’ materials. However, the global emergent mechanics that arise from the local interactions of individual particles are not well understood. In this study, we examine the emergent properties of amorphous entangled systems in an
              in silico
              collection of u-shaped particles (“smarticles”) and in living entangled aggregate of worm blobs (
              L. variegatus
              ). In simulations, we examine how material properties change for a collective composed of smarticles as they undergo different forcing protocols. We compare three methods of controlling entanglement in the collective: external oscillations of the ensemble, sudden shape-changes of all individuals, and sustained internal oscillations of all individuals. We find that large-amplitude changes of the particle's shape using the shape-change procedure produce the largest average number of entanglements, with respect to the aspect ratio (
              l
              /
              w
              ), thus improving the tensile strength of the collective. We demonstrate applications of these simulations by showing how the individual worm activity in a blob can be controlled through the ambient dissolved oxygen in water, leading to complex emergent properties of the living entangled collective, such as solid-like entanglement and tumbling. Our work reveals principles by which future shape-modulating, potentially soft robotic systems may dynamically alter their material properties, advancing our understanding of living entangled materials, while inspiring new classes of synthetic emergent super-materials.},

We study the behaviors of ensembles composed of smart active particles, smarticles. Smarticles are small, low cost robots equipped with basic actuation and sensing abilities that are individually incapable of rotating or displacing. We demonstrate that a "supersmarticle", composed of many smarticles constrained within a bounding membrane, can harness the internal collisions of the robotic material among the constituents and the membrane to achieve diffusive locomotion. The emergent diffusion can be directed by modulating the robotic material properties in response to a light source, analogous to biological phototaxis. The light source introduces asymmetries within the robotic material, resulting in modified populations of interaction modes and dynamics which ultimately result in supersmarticle biased locomotion. We present experimental methods and results for the robotic material which moves with a directed displacement in response to a light source.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Soft robotic systems typically follow conventional control schemes, where actuators are supplied with dedicated inputs that are regulated through software. However, in recent years an alternative trend is being explored, where the control architecture can be simplified by harnessing the passive mechanical characteristics of the soft robotic system. This approach is named “morphological control”, and it can be used to decrease the number of components (tubing, valves and regulators) required by the controller. In this paper, we demonstrate morphological control of bio-inspired asymmetric motions for systems of soft bending actuators that are interconnected with passive flow restrictors. We introduce bending actuators consisting out of a cylindrical latex balloon in a flexible PVC shell. By tuning the radii of the tube and the shell, we obtain a nonlinear relation between internal pressure and volume in the actuator with a peak and valley in pressure. Because of the nonlinear characteristics of the actuators, they can be assembled in a system with a single pressure input where they bend in a discrete, preprogrammed sequence. We design and analyze two such systems inspired by the asymmetric movements of biological cilia. The first replicates the swept area of individual cilia, having a different forward and backward stroke, and the second generates a travelling wave across an array of cilia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

An analytical and simulation study in two spatial dimensions reveals that pursuit performance depends on the interplay between self-propulsion, active reorientation, limited maneuverability, and random noise. Noise is found to have two opposing effects: (i) it is necessary to disturb regular, quasi-elliptical orbits around the target, and (ii) slows down pursuit by increasing the traveled distance of the pursuer. For a stationary target, we predict a universal scaling behavior of the mean pursuer–target distance and of the mean first-passage time as a function of Pe2/Ω, where the Péclet number Pe characterizes the activity and Ω the maneuverability. Importantly, the scaling variable Pe2/Ω depends implicitly on the level of thermal or active noise. A similar behavior is found for a moving target, but modified by the velocity ratio α = u 0/v 0 of target and pursuer velocities u 0 and v 0, respectively. We also propose a strategy to sort active pursuers according to their motility by circular target trajectories.},

The dynamics of the active Brownian particles is extended by an orientational response with limited maneuverability to an instantaneous visual input of the positions of neighbors within a vision cone and a cut-off radius. The system exhibits large-scale self-organized structures, which depend on selected parameter values, and, in particular, the presence of excluded-volume interactions. The emergent structures in two dimensions, such as worms, worm-aggregate coexistence, and hexagonally close-packed structures, are analysed and phase diagrams are constructed. The analysis of the particle's mean-square displacement shows ABP-like dynamics for dilute systems and the worm phase. In the limit of densely packed structures, the active diffusion coefficient is significantly smaller and depends on the number of particles in the cluster. Our analysis of the cluster-growth dynamics shows distinct differences to processes in systems of short-range attractive colloids in equilibrium. Specifically, the characteristic time for the growth and decay of clusters of a particular size is longer than that of isotropically attractive colloids, which we attribute to the non-reciprocal nature of the directed visual perception. Our simulations reveal a strong interplay between ABP-characteristic interactions, such as volume exclusion and rotational diffusion, and cognitive-based interactions and navigation.},

	abstract = {Understanding the navigation through semi-dense crowds at intersections poses a significant challenge in pedestrian dynamics, with implications for facility design and insights into emergent collective behavior. To tackle this problem, a system of cognitive active agents at a crowded three-way intersection is studied using Langevin simulations of intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) with directed visual perception (resulting in non-reciprocal interactions) and self-steering avoidance—without volume exclusion. We find that the emergent self-organization depends on agent maneuverability, goal fixation, and vision angle, and identify several forms of collective behavior, including localized flocking, jamming and percolation, and self-organized rotational flows. Additionally, we demonstrate that the motion of individual agents can be characterized by fractional Brownian motion and Lévy walk models across different parameter regimes. Moreover, despite the rich variety of collective behavior, the fundamental flow diagram shows a universal curve for different vision angles. Our research highlights the impact of collision avoidance, goal following, and vision angle on the individual and collective dynamics of interacting pedestrians.},

However, integrating heterogeneous components into micromachines with specified structure, dynamics and function is still challenging. Here, we describe the dynamic self-assembly of mobile micromachines with desired configurations through pre-programmed physical interactions between structural and motor units. The assembly is driven by dielectrophoretic interactions, encoded in the three-dimensional shape of the individual parts. Micromachines assembled from magnetic and self-propelled motor parts exhibit reconfigurable locomotion modes and additional rotational degrees of freedom that are not available to conventional monolithic microrobots. The versatility of this site-selective assembly strategy is demonstrated on different reconfigurable, hierarchical and three-dimensional micromachine assemblies. Our results demonstrate how shape-encoded assembly pathways enable programmable, reconfigurable mobile micromachines. We anticipate that the presented design principle will advance and inspire the development of more sophisticated, modular micromachines and their integration into multiscale hierarchical systems.},

	abstract = {Biological organisms achieve robust high-level behaviours by combining and coordinating stochastic low-level components1–3. By contrast, most current robotic systems comprise either monolithic mechanisms4,5 or modular units with coordinated motions6,7. Such robots require explicit control of individual components to perform specific functions, and the failure of one component typically renders the entire robot inoperable. Here we demonstrate a robotic system whose overall behaviour can be successfully controlled by exploiting statistical mechanics phenomena. We achieve this by incorporating many loosely coupled ‘particles’, which are incapable of independent locomotion and do not possess individual identity or addressable position. In the proposed system, each particle is permitted to perform only uniform volumetric oscillations that are phase-modulated by a global signal. Despite the stochastic motion of the robot and lack of direct control of its individual components, we demonstrate physical robots composed of up to two dozen particles and simulated robots with up to 100,000 particles capable of robust locomotion, object transport and phototaxis (movement towards a light stimulus). Locomotion is maintained even when 20 per cent of the particles malfunction. These findings indicate that stochastic systems may offer an alternative approach to more complex and exacting robots via large-scale robust amorphous robotic systems that exhibit deterministic behaviour.},

The field of microrobotics strives to achieve these functions in mobile robotic systems of sub-millimetre size. However, miniaturization of traditional robots and their control systems to the microscale is not a viable approach. A promising alternative strategy in developing microrobots is to implement sensing, actuation and control directly in the materials, thereby mimicking biological matter. In this Review, we discuss design principles and materials for the implementation of robotic functionalities in microrobots. We examine different biological locomotion strategies, and we discuss how they can be artificially recreated in magnetic microrobots and how soft materials improve control and performance. We show that smart, stimuli-responsive materials can act as on-board sensors and actuators and that ‘active matter’ enables autonomous motion, navigation and collective behaviours. Finally, we provide a critical outlook for the field of microrobotics and highlight the challenges that need to be overcome to realize sophisticated microrobots, which one day might rival biological machines.},

To this end, significant efforts have been made in developing reconfigurable multifunctional smart materials, which can exhibit remarkable behaviors such as morphing and self-healing. However, the difficulty in efficiently manipulating and controlling matter at the building block level with manageable cost and complexity, which is crucial to achieving superior responsiveness to environmental clues and stimuli, has significantly hindered the further development of such smart materials. Here we introduce a concept of Robo-Matter, which can be activated and controlled through external information exchange at the building block level, to enable a high-level of controllability, mutability and versatility for reconfigurable multifunctional smart materials. Using specially designed micro-robot building blocks with symmetry-breaking active motion modes, tunable anisotropic interactions, and interactive coupling with a programmable spatial-temporal dynamic light field, we demonstrate an emergent Robot-Matter duality, which enables a spectrum of desirable behaviors spanning from matter-like properties such as ultra-fast self-assembly and adaptivity, to robot-like properties including active force output, smart healing, smart morphing and infiltration. Our work demonstrates a promising direction for designing next-generation smart materials and large-scale robotic swarms.},

Consequently, task information is encoded in both their brains and their bodies. In robotics, the development of complex control and planning algorithms often bears sole responsibility for improving task performance. This dependence on centralized control can be problematic for systems with computational limitations, such as mechanical systems and robots on the microscale. In these cases we need to be able to offload complex computation onto the physical morphology of the system. To this end, we introduce a methodology for algorithmically arranging sensing and actuation components into a robot design while maintaining a low level of design complexity (quantified using a measure of graph entropy), and a high level of task embodiment (evaluated by analyzing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between physical executions of the robot and those of an idealized system). This approach computes an idealized, unconstrained control policy which is projected onto a limited selection of sensors and actuators in a given library, resulting in intelligence that is distributed away from a central processor and instead embodied in the physical body of a robot. The method is demonstrated by computationally optimizing a simulated synthetic cell.},

We investigate how simple steric interaction constraints between active individuals produce a versatile active system with promising functionality. Here we introduce the link-bot: a V-shape-based, single-stranded chain composed of active bots whose dynamics are defined by its geometric link constraints, allowing it to possess scale- and processing-free programmable collective behaviors. A variety of emergent properties arise from this dynamic system, including locomotion, navigation, transportation, and competitive or cooperative interactions. Through the control of a few link parameters, link-bots show rich usefulness by performing a variety of divergent tasks, including traversing or obstructing narrow spaces, passing by or enclosing objects, and propelling loads in both forward and backward directions. The reconfigurable nature of the link-bot suggests that our approach may significantly contribute to the development of programmable soft robotic systems with minimal information and materials at any scale.},

However, these machines also have disadvantages, as they respond with complex body dynamics when stimulated. These dynamics exhibit a variety of properties, including nonlinearity, memory and potentially infinitely many degrees of freedom, which are often difficult to control. Here, we demonstrate that these seemingly undesirable properties can in fact be assets that can be exploited for real-time computation. Using body dynamics generated from a soft silicone arm, we show that they can be employed to emulate desired nonlinear dynamical systems. First, by using benchmark tasks, we demonstrate that the nonlinearity and memory within the body dynamics can increase the computational performance. Second, we characterize our system’s computational capability by comparing its task performance with a standard machine learning technique and identify its range of validity and limitation. Our results suggest that soft bodies are not only impressive in their deformability and flexibility but can also be potentially used as computational resources on top and for free.},

In this work, we study the ways in which intelligent behavior can be created without a separate and explicit brain for robot control, but rather solely as a result of the computation occurring within the physical body of a robot. Specifically, we show that adaptive and complex behavior can be created in voxel-based virtual soft robots by using simple reactive materials that actively change the shape of the robot, and thus its behavior, under different environmental cues. We demonstrate a proof of concept for the idea of closed-loop morphological computation, and show that in our implementation, it enables behavior mimicking logic gates, enabling us to demonstrate how such behaviors may be combined to build up more complex collective behaviors.},

	abstract = {Information engines can use structured environments as a resource to generate work by randomizing ordered inputs and leveraging the increased Shannon entropy to transfer energy from a thermal reservoir to a work reservoir. We give a broadly applicable expression for the work production of an information engine, generally modeled as a memoryful channel that communicates inputs to outputs as it interacts with an evolving environment. The expression establishes that an information engine must have more than one memory state in order to leverage input environment correlations. To emphasize this functioning, we designed an information engine powered solely by temporal correlations and not by statistical biases, as employed by previous engines. Key to this is the engine's ability to synchronize—the engine automatically returns to a desired dynamical phase when thrown into an unwanted, dissipative phase by corruptions in the input—that is, by unanticipated environmental fluctuations. This self-correcting mechanism is robust up to a critical level of corruption, beyond which the system fails to act as an engine. We give explicit analytical expressions for both work and critical corruption level and summarize engine performance via a thermodynamic-function phase diagram over engine control parameters. The results reveal a thermodynamic mechanism based on nonergodicity that underlies error correction as it operates to support resilient engineered and biological systems.},

	abstract = {Soft adaptable materials that change their shapes, volumes, and properties in response to changes under ambient conditions have important applications in tissue engineering, soft robotics, biosensing, and flexible displays. Upon water absorption, most existing soft materials, such as hydrogels, show a positive volume change, corresponding to a positive swelling. By contrast, the negative swelling represents a relatively unusual phenomenon that does not exist in most natural materials. The development of material systems capable of large or anisotropic negative swelling remains a challenge. We combine analytic modeling, finite element analyses, and experiments to design a type of soft mechanical metamaterials that can achieve large effective negative swelling ratios and tunable stress-strain curves, with desired isotropic/anisotropic features. This material system exploits horseshoe-shaped composite microstructures of hydrogel and passive materials as the building blocks, which extend into a periodic network, following the lattice constructions. The building block structure leverages a sandwiched configuration to convert the hydraulic swelling deformations of hydrogel into bending deformations, thereby resulting in an effective shrinkage (up to around −47\% linear strain) of the entire network. By introducing spatially heterogeneous designs, we demonstrated a range of unusual, anisotropic swelling responses, including those with expansion in one direction and, simultaneously, shrinkage along the perpendicular direction. The design approach, as validated by experiments, allows the determination of tailored microstructure geometries to yield desired length/area changes. These design concepts expand the capabilities of existing soft materials and hold promising potential for applications in a diverse range of areas.},

At room temperature, we find a tendency of the pPA foldamer to collapse into a helical structure in all three solvents but with rather different stability character, stable in water, marginally stable in n-hexane, unstable in cyclohexane. In the case of water, the initial and final number of hydrogen bonds of the foldamer with water molecules is found to be unchanged, with no formation of intrachain hydrogen bonding, thus indicating that hydrogen bonding plays no role in the folding process. In all three solvents, the folding is found to be mainly driven by electrostatics, nearly identical in the three cases, and largely dominant compared to van der Waals interactions that are different in the three cases. This scenario is also supported by the analysis of distribution of the bond and dihedral angles and by a direct calculation of the solvation and transfer free energies via thermodynamic integration. The different stability in the case of cyclohexane and n-hexane notwithstanding their rather similar chemical composition can be traced back to the different entropy–enthalpy compensation that is found similar for water and n-hexane, and very different for cyclohexane. A comparison with the same properties for poly-phenylalanine oligomers underscores the crucial differences between pPA and peptides. To highlight how these findings can hardly be interpreted in terms of a simple “good” and “poor” solvent picture, a molecular dynamics study of a bead-spring polymer chain in a Lennard-Jones fluid is also included.},

	abstract = {Using Langevin dynamics complemented by Wang–Landau Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase behavior of single and multiple semiflexible polymer chains in solution under poor-solvent conditions. In the case of a single chain, we obtain the full phase diagram in the temperature-bending rigidity (stiffness) plane and we provide connections with a classical mean field result on a lattice as well as with past results on the same model. At low bending rigidity and upon cooling, we find a second-order coil-globule transition, followed by a subsequent first-order globule-crystal transition at lower temperatures. The obtained crystals have the shape of a twisted rod, whose length increases with the increase of the stiffness of the chain. Above a critical value of the stiffness, we also find a direct first-order globule-crystal transition, with the crystal having the form of a twisted toroid. Close to the triple point, we find a region with isoenergetic structures with frequent switching from rods to toroids, with the toroid eventually becoming the only observed stable phase at a higher stiffness. The model is then extended to many thermally equilibrated chains in a box, and the analogous phase diagram is deduced where the chains are observed to first fold into a globule bundle at low stiffness upon cooling and then rearrange into a nematic bundle via a nucleation process involving an isotropic–nematic transition. As in the single-chain counterpart, above a critical stiffness, the chains are observed to undergo a direct transition from a gas of isotropically distributed chains to a nematic bundle as the temperature decreases, in agreement with recent suggestions from mean field theory. The consequences of these findings for the self-assembly of biopolymers in solutions are discussed.},

	abstract = {In living cells, proteins self-assemble into large functional structures based on specific interactions between molecularly complex patches. Because of this complexity, protein self-assembly results from a competition between a large number of distinct interaction energies, of the order of one per pair of patches. However, current self-assembly models typically ignore this aspect, and the principles by which it determines the large-scale structure of protein assemblies are largely unknown. Here, we use Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning to start to unravel these principles. We observe that despite widespread geometrical frustration, aggregates of particles with complex interactions fall within only a few categories that often display high degrees of spatial order, including crystals, fibers, and oligomers. We then successfully identify the most relevant aspect of the interaction complexity in predicting these outcomes, namely, the particles’ ability to form periodic structures. Our results provide a first extensive characterization of the rich design space associated with identical particles with complex interactions and could inspire engineered self-assembling nano-objects as well as help us to understand the emergence of robust functional protein structures.},

A versatile and simple concept to realize this function is the exploitation of microcapsules that are filled with solutions of dyes that are released and chemically or physically activated when the protective shell is damaged. Such microcapsules can readily be incorporated into polymers and the composites thus made can be processed into films, coatings, or other objects. Mechanochromic effects can be realized with different types of dyes and activation schemes. In this concept article, a selection of recent key studies is presented to provide an overview of the state of the field. Different architectures and operating principles and their advantages and drawbacks are reviewed. The parameters that influence the design of microcapsule-based mechanochromic systems are considered and unexplored chromophore systems that might be useful to design future self-reporting polymers are discussed. Finally, specific aspects of capsule design, fabrication, and integration into polymers are presented. Throughout the article, challenges and opportunities of the concept are highlighted and possible future directions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Self-reporting materials have emerged as a promising tool for real-time monitoring of stress and damage in structural materials. When critical stress is applied to these materials, an optical response is triggered – for example by dye release, or molecular cleavage. A key challenge is to extend these systems to respond to multiple different stress levels. To achieve this, a novel microcapsule-based assembly strategy is presented. Microfluidic synthesis is used to create microcapsules that release dye at a precise level of applied force. Subsequently, capillary assembly is used to combine microcapsules with different stress-responsiveness and different fluorescent dyes into chains, which are uniformly patterned into regular arrays, and embed these into the self-reporting materials. Through indentation experiments, it is shown that these materials can distinguish and record spatially resolved local stresses based on the fluorescence emitted upon microcapsule rupture. Crucially, the technique's accuracy is significantly improved when microcapsules are spatially organized within the material. This versatile technique can be applied to a range of different materials, via the use of thin coatings containing the regularly patterned microcapsule chains.},

	abstract = {The important issues in the conventional rotating vibration energy harvester are that the energy transfer efficiency and the fatigue life were limited because considering only the simply transferred force direction. Thus, this work focuses on the improving energy efficiency of piezoelectric energy harvester with a novel fractal structure. The harvester is based not only on an optimization model analysis, but also on an experimental investigation of coupling coefficients (structural and piezoelectric coupling) that can significantly affect efficiency performance. A model with a single-degree of freedom is developed and then optimized a structure model, yielding fractal-form design and verifications of performance analysis. In order to verify the optimized model, experimental tests are undertaken on a partial fractal structure energy harvester with each of the transmitted force angles. The harvester efficiently converts all responses transmitted at various frequencies. However, by incomplete harvester assembly conditions, shows unusual hysteresis curve tendencies. Especially, the nonlinearity by a fractal structure in single-mode tends to average about 40\% in vertical vibration, while the nonlinearity by tangent direction tends to decrease to about 20\%. When the harvester is applied to the bearing system, it is observed that the stiffness and damping ratios of the bearing-rotor system by the elastic capacity increase according to the electromechanical characteristic of the energy harvester. As a result, it generates up to 7 mW with the force transmitted by the bearing vibration. It is suggested that the optimal harvester design for increasing energy efficiency of bearing applications, and the importance of nonlinearity study (hysteresis behavior by a friction effect) for harvester performance.},

The introduction of fractal topology into transducers significantly alleviates the inherent limitation of a narrow working bandwidth in commonly used cantilever PEHs.

Our findings reveal that the higher-order fractal structures generate an increased number of eigenfrequencies as well as modal patterns within a certain range of working bandwidth (i.e., \&lt;50 Hz). Experimental results indicate that the efficient energy harvesting bandwidth of the fractal PEHs of iterative levels 1 and 2 is 2.05 and 2.15 times, respectively, larger than the conventional PEHs (i.e., level 0). In addition, the harvested voltage and power of fractal PEHs can be enhanced by attaching a proof mass to compensate for the energy loss in producing iterations. This method exhibits superiority over capturing energy in low-frequency vibration environments, such as wave energy and human movement energy.},

Especially interesting are simple systems that provide unexpected examples of memory, decision-making, or problem-solving in substrates that at first glance do not appear to be complex enough to implement such capabilities. We seek to develop tools to determine minimal requirements for such capabilities, and to learn to recognize and predict basal forms of intelligence in unconventional substrates. Here, we apply novel analyses to the behavior of classical sorting algorithms—short pieces of code studied for many decades. To study these sorting algorithms as a model of biological morphogenesis and its competencies, we break two formerly ubiquitous assumptions: top-down control (instead, each element within an array of numbers can exert minimal agency and implement sorting policies from the bottom up), and fully reliable hardware (instead, allowing elements to be “damaged” and fail to execute the algorithm). We quantitatively characterize sorting activity as traversal of a problem space, showing that arrays of autonomous elements sort themselves more reliably and robustly than traditional implementations in the presence of errors. Moreover, we find the ability to temporarily reduce progress in order to navigate around a defect, and unexpected clustering behavior among elements in chimeric arrays consisting of two different algorithms. The discovery of emergent problem-solving capacities in simple, familiar algorithms contributes a new perspective showing how basal forms of intelligence can emerge in simple systems without being explicitly encoded in their underlying mechanics.},

	abstract = {Evolution by natural selection is believed to be the only possible source of spontaneous adaptive organisation in the natural world. This places strict limits on the kinds of systems that can exhibit adaptation spontaneously, i.e., without design. Physical systems can show some properties relevant to adaptation without natural selection or design. (1) The relaxation, or local energy minimisation, of a physical system constitutes a natural form of optimisation insomuch as it finds locally optimal solutions to the frustrated forces acting on it or between its components. (2) When internal structure ‘gives way’ or accommodates a pattern of forcing on a system, this constitutes learning insomuch, as it can store, recall, and generalise past configurations. Both these effects are quite natural and general, but in themselves insufficient to constitute non-trivial adaptation. However, here we show that the recurrent interaction of physical optimisation and physical learning together results in significant spontaneous adaptive organisation. We call this adaptation by natural induction. The effect occurs in dynamical systems described by a network of viscoelastic connections subject to occasional disturbances. When the internal structure of such a system accommodates slowly across many disturbances and relaxations, it spontaneously learns to preferentially visit solutions of increasingly greater quality (exceptionally low energy). We show that adaptation by natural induction thus produces network organisations that improve problem-solving competency with experience (without supervised training or system-level reward). We note that the conditions for adaptation by natural induction, and its adaptive competency, are different from those of natural selection. We therefore suggest that natural selection is not the only possible source of spontaneous adaptive organisation in the natural world.},

The energetic cost of cellular differentiation has not been directly quantified, representing a gap in knowledge.

For example, reptiles, crustaceans, and insects amputate their own appendages in response to threats. Temporary fusion between individuals enables collective behaviors, such as in ants that temporarily fuse to build bridges. The concept of morphological editing often involves the addition and subtraction of mass and can be linked to modular robotics, wherein synthetic body morphology may be revised by rearranging parts. This work describes a reversible cohesive interface made of thermoplastic elastomer that allows for strong attachment and easy detachment of distributed soft robot modules without direct human handling. The reversible joint boasts a modulus similar to materials commonly used in soft robotics, and can thus be distributed throughout soft robot bodies without introducing mechanical incongruities. To demonstrate utility, the reversible joint is implemented in two embodiments: a soft quadruped robot that self-amputates a limb when stuck, and a cluster of three soft-crawling robots that fuse to cross a land gap. This work points toward future robots capable of radical shape-shifting via changes in mass through autotomy and interfusion, as well as highlights the crucial role that interfacial stiffness change plays in autotomizable biological and artificial systems.},

Here, I focus on complementary aspects: the need for agents to dynamically reinterpret and modify memories to suit their ever-changing selves and environment. Using examples from developmental biology, evolution, and synthetic bioengineering, in addition to neuroscience, I propose that a perspective on memory as preserving salience, not fidelity, is applicable to many phenomena on scales from cells to societies. Continuous commitment to creative, adaptive confabulation, from the molecular to the behavioral levels, is the answer to the persistence paradox as it applies to individuals and whole lineages. I also speculate that a substrate-independent, processual view of life and mind suggests that memories, as patterns in the excitable medium of cognitive systems, could be seen as active agents in the sense-making process. I explore a view of life as a diverse set of embodied perspectives—nested agents who interpret each other’s and their own past messages and actions as best as they can (polycomputation). This synthesis suggests unifying symmetries across scales and disciplines, which is of relevance to research programs in Diverse Intelligence and the engineering of novel embodied minds.},

Crucially however, biology is not only nested structurally, but also functionally: each level is able to solve problems in distinct problem spaces, such as physiological, morphological, and behavioral state space. Percolating adaptive functionality from one level of competent subunits to a higher functional level of organization requires collective dynamics: multiple components must work together to achieve specific outcomes. Here we overview a number of biological examples at different scales which highlight the ability of cellular material to make decisions that implement cooperation toward specific homeodynamic endpoints, and implement collective intelligence by solving problems at the cell, tissue, and whole-organism levels. We explore the hypothesis that collective intelligence is not only the province of groups of animals, and that an important symmetry exists between the behavioral science of swarms and the competencies of cells and other biological systems at different scales.

We argue that formalisms describing multiscale competencies and goal-directedness in biology (e.g., TAME), and reinforcement learning (RL), can be combined in a symbiotic framework. While RL has been largely focused on higher-level organisms and robots of high complexity, TAME is naturally capable of describing lower-level organisms and minimal agents as well. We propose several novel questions that come from using RL/TAME to understand biology as well as ones that come from using biology to formulate new theory in AI. We hope that the research programs proposed in this piece shape future efforts to understand biological organisms and also future efforts to build artificial agents.},

This paper addresses self-organization of biological systems in relation to—and nested within—other biological systems in pregnancy. Pregnancy constitutes a fundamental state for human embodiment and a key step in the evolution and conservation of our species. While not all humans can be pregnant, our initial state of emerging and growing within another person's body is universal. Hence, the pregnant state does not concern some individuals but all individuals. Indeed, the hierarchical relationship in pregnancy reflects an even earlier autopoietic process in the embryo by which the number of individuals in a single blastoderm is dynamically determined by cell– interactions. The relationship and the interactions between the two self-organizing systems during pregnancy may play a pivotal role in understanding the nature of biological self-organization per se in humans. Specifically, we consider the role of the immune system in biological self-organization in addition to neural/brain systems that furnish us with a sense of self. We examine the complex case of pregnancy, whereby two immune systems need to negotiate the exchange of resources and information in order to maintain viable self-regulation of nested systems. We conclude with a proposal for the mechanisms—that scaffold the complex relationship between two self-organising systems in pregnancy—through the lens of the Active Inference, with a focus on shared Markov blankets.},

	abstract = {Brains implement some of the most complex functions of living systems including intelligence, decision-making, learning, and sentience, which is the capacity for subjective experience. To better understand these and other cognitive functions, neuroscientists have meticulously delineated the brain’s microcircuitry and pathways to relate mental phenomena with discrete neural substrates. One of the driving forces behind what has become an ever-expanding literature on functional neuroanatomy is the longstanding assumption that all mental actions and states can be localized, mapped, or otherwise attributed to specific configurations of brain matter. Consistent with this assumption, by selectively damaging or stimulating brain regions, one could suppress or evoke cognitive or behavioral responses that confirmed suspected structure-function relationships. While this approach has not helped explain why mind emerges from matter, its historical success is a crowning achievement for the field of cognitive neuroscience and continues to support clinical research (Gratton et al., 2020; Suárez et al., 2020). However, we now know that an impressive variety of distinct brain morphologies can implement similar mental processes ranging from associative learning to context-dependent decision-making (Lefebvre and Sol, 2008). The same can be said of comparatively simple ganglia (Sarnat and Netsky, 2002), neural explants (Shultz et al., 2017), and tissue engineered neural cultures (Rouleau et al., 2021; Rouleau, 2022; Rouleau et al., 2023). Further support for the generalizability of cognitive function beyond brains, we have learned that several non-neural organisms display response patterns consistent with animal cognition (Boisseau et al., 2016; Smith-Ferguson and Beekman, 2020). And, indeed, we have now engineered artificially intelligent and bio-robotic hybrid systems that display self-organizing cognitive response patterns (DeMarse et al., 2001; Potter et al., 2003).

This paper argues that a promising way forward in understanding the nature of human cognition is to zoom out from the prevailing picture focusing on its neural basis. It considers instead how neurons work in tandem with other type of cells (e.g., immune) to subserve biological self-organization and adaptive behavior of the human organism as a whole. We focus specifically on the immune cellular processing as key actor in complementing neuronal processing in achieving successful self-organization and adaptation of the human body in an ever-changing environment. We overview theoretical work and empirical evidence on “basal cognition” challenging the idea that only the neuronal cells in the brain have the exclusive ability to “learn” or “cognize.” The focus on cellular rather than neural, brain processing underscores the idea that flexible responses to fluctuations in the environment require a carefully crafted orchestration of multiple cellular and bodily systems at multiple organizational levels of the biological organism. Hence cognition can be seen as a multiscale web of dynamic information processing distributed across a vast array of complex cellular (e.g., neuronal, immune, and others) and network systems, operating across the entire body, and not just in the brain. Ultimately, this paper builds up toward the radical claim that cognition should not be confined to one system alone, namely, the neural system in the brain, no matter how sophisticated the latter notoriously is.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Morphogenesis, the establishment and repair of emergent complex anatomy by groups of cells, is a fascinating and biomedically-relevant problem. One of its most fascinating aspects is that a developing embryo can reliably recover from disturbances, such as splitting into twins. While this reliability implies some type of goal-seeking error minimization over a morphogenic field, there are many gaps with respect to detailed, constructive models of such a process. A common way to achieve reliability is negative feedback, which requires characterizing the existing body shape to create an error signal–but measuring properties of a shape may not be simple. We show how cells communicating in a wave-like pattern could analyze properties of the current body shape. We then describe a closed-loop negative-feedback system for creating reaction-diffusion (RD) patterns with high reliability. Specifically, we use a wave to count the number of peaks in a RD pattern, letting us use a negative-feedback controller to create a pattern with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} repetitions, where {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} can be altered over a wide range. Furthermore, the individual repetitions of the RD pattern can be easily stretched or shrunk under genetic control to create, e.g., some morphological features larger than others. This work contributes to the exciting effort of understanding design principles of morphological computation, which can be used to understand evolved developmental mechanisms, manipulate them in regenerative-medicine settings, or engineer novel synthetic morphology constructs with desired robust behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              Fundamental knowledge gaps exist about the plasticity of cells from adult soma and the potential diversity of body shape and behavior in living constructs derived from genetically wild‐type cells. Here anthrobots are introduced, a spheroid‐shaped multicellular biological robot (biobot) platform with diameters ranging from 30 to 500 microns and cilia‐powered locomotive abilities. Each Anthrobot begins as a single cell, derived from the adult human lung, and self‐constructs into a multicellular motile biobot after being cultured in extra cellular matrix for 2 weeks and transferred into a minimally viscous habitat. Anthrobots exhibit diverse behaviors with motility patterns ranging from tight loops to straight lines and speeds ranging from 5–50 microns s

              . The anatomical investigations reveal that this behavioral diversity is significantly correlated with their morphological diversity. Anthrobots can assume morphologies with fully polarized or wholly ciliated bodies and spherical or ellipsoidal shapes, each related to a distinct movement type. Anthrobots are found to be capable of traversing, and inducing rapid repair of scratches in, cultured human neural cell sheets in vitro. By controlling microenvironmental cues in bulk, novel structures, with new and unexpected behavior and biomedically‐relevant capabilities, can be discovered in morphogenetic processes without direct genetic editing or manual sculpting.},

How the first self-sustaining metabolic networks arose at life's origin is a major open question. Autocatalytic sets smaller than metabolic networks were proposed as transitory intermediates at the origin of life, but evidence for their role in prebiotic evolution is lacking. Here, we identify reflexively autocatalytic food-generated networks (RAFs)—self-sustaining networks that collectively catalyse all their reactions—embedded within microbial metabolism. RAFs in the metabolism of ancient anaerobic autotrophs that live from H2 and CO2 provided with small-molecule catalysts generate acetyl-CoA as well as amino acids and bases, the monomeric components of protein and RNA, but amino acids and bases without organic catalysts do not generate metabolic RAFs. This suggests that RAFs identify attributes of biochemical origins conserved in metabolic networks. RAFs are consistent with an autotrophic origin of metabolism and furthermore indicate that autocatalytic chemical networks preceded proteins and RNA in evolution. RAFs uncover intermediate stages in the emergence of metabolic networks, narrowing the gaps between early Earth chemistry and life.},

	abstract = {In polymers, the equilibrium state is achieved when the chains have access to the maximum number of conformational states, which allows them to explore a larger conformational space, leading to an increase in the entropy of the system. Preparation of thin polymer films using the spin-coating technique results in polymer chains being locked in a nonequilibrium state with lower entropy due to possible stretching of chains during the process. Allowing enough time for recovery results in the relaxation of the spin-coating-induced molecular recoiling stress. Annealing such a film generates entropy due to its inherent irreversibility. We employed the dewetting technique to determine the molecular recoiling stress relaxation time in poly-(tertbutyl styrene) thin films. Furthermore, we qualitatively differentiated the metastable states achieved by the polymer film using entropy generation in a relaxing polymer film as an effect of thermal entropy and associated it with the conformational entropy of polymer chains utilizing the molecular recoiling stress relaxation time. This enabled us to explain molecular recoiling stress relaxation using a rather simplistic approach involving segmental level molecular rearrangements in polymer chains by attaining transient metastable states through an entropically activated process driving toward equilibrium.},

            The study of motility control by smart agents offers a promising platform for systematically exploring the fundamental physical constraints underlying the functioning of bio-inspired micro-machines operating far from equilibrium. Here, we address the question of the energy expenditure required for a self-steering active agent to localise itself within a specific region of space or follow a pre-defined trajectory under the influence of fluctuations and external flows. Building on a stochastic thermodynamic formulation of the problem, we derive a generic relationship between dissipation and localisation accuracy, which reveals a fundamental dissipation-accuracy tradeoff constraining the agent’s performance. In addition, we illustrate how our framework enables the derivation of optimal steering policies that achieve localisation at minimum energy expenditure.},

Enhancing the intelligence of micromachines to tackle the uncertainty and variability in complex microenvironments has applications in minimally invasive medicine, bioengineering, water cleaning, analytical chemistry, and more. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the construction of intelligent micromachines, evolving from simple micromachines to soft, compound, reconfigurable, encodable, multifunctional, and integrated micromachines, as well as from individual to multiagent, multiscale, hierarchical, self-organizing, and swarm micromachines. The field leverages two important trends in robotics research—the miniaturization and intelligentization of machines—but a compelling combination of these two features has yet to be realized. The core technologies required to make such tiny machines intelligent include information media, transduction, processing, exchange, and energy supply, but embedding all of these functions into a system at the micro- or nanoscale is challenging. This article offers a comprehensive introduction to the state-of-the-art technologies used to create intelligence for micromachines and provides insight into the construction of next-generation intelligent micromachines that can adapt to diverse scenarios for use in emerging fields.},

	abstract = {Activity and autonomous motion are fundamental aspects of many living and engineering systems. Here, the scale of biological agents covers a wide range, from nanomotors, cytoskeleton, and cells, to insects, fish, birds, and people. Inspired by biological active systems, various types of autonomous synthetic nano- and micromachines have been designed, which provide the basis for multifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent active materials. A major challenge for understanding and designing active matter is their inherent non-equilibrium nature due to persistent energy consumption, which invalidates equilibrium concepts such as free energy, detailed balance, and time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, interactions in ensembles of active agents are often non-additive and non-reciprocal. An important aspect of biological agents is their ability to sense the environment, process this information, and adjust their motion accordingly. It is an important goal for the engineering of micro-robotic systems to achieve similar functionality.  With many fundamental properties of motile active matter now reasonably well understood and under control, the ground is prepared for the study of physical aspects and mechanisms of motion in complex environments, of the behavior of systems with new physical features like chirality, of the development of novel micromachines and microbots, of the emergent collective behavior and swarming of intelligent self-propelled particles, and of particular features of microbial systems.  The vast complexity of phenomena and mechanisms involved in the self-organization and dynamics of motile active matter poses major challenges, which can only be addressed by a truly interdisciplinary effort involving scientists from biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, mathematics, and physics. The 2024 motile active matter roadmap of Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter reviews the current state of the art of the field and provides guidance for further progress in this fascinating research area.},

This book chapter briefly discusses existing approaches to make synthetic particles increasingly "intelligent" and then focuses on the usage of machine learning to approach navigation and communication problems of active particles. Basic questions are how to steer a single active agent through a complex environment to reach or discover a target in an optimal way and how active particles need to cooperate to efficiently collect a distribution of targets (e.g. nutrients or toxins) from their complex environment.},

Therefore, it is essential to advance the PI of human-made agents as much as possible, in addition to their CI, to operate them in unstructured and complex real-world environments like the biological agents. This article gives a perspective on what PI paradigm is, when PI can be more significant and dominant in physical and biological agents at different length scales and how bioinspired and abstract PI methods can be created in agent bodies. PI paradigm aims to synergize and merge many research fields, such as mechanics, materials science, robotics, mechanical design, fluidics, active matter, biology, self-assembly and collective systems, to enable advanced PI capabilities in human-made agent bodies, comparable to the ones observed in biological organisms.

Their physical actuation on the fluid may be mathematically modeled as the generation of surface velocities on a continuous spherical surface—a model known in the literature as squirming, which has been used to address various aspects of the biological physics of locomotion. Previous analyses of squirming assumed axisymmetric fluid motion and hence required all swimming kinematics to take place along a line. In this paper we generalize squirming to three spatial dimensions. We derive analytically the flow field surrounding a spherical squirmer with arbitrary surface motion and use it to derive its three-dimensional translational and rotational swimming kinematics. We then use our results to physically interpret the flow field induced by the swimmer in terms of fundamental flow singularities up to terms decaying spatially as \$\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \} 1/r{\textasciicircum}3\$\$. Our results will make it possible to develop new models in biological physics, in particular in the area of hydrodynamic interactions and collective locomotion.},

Transferring similar functionalities to synthetic microswimmers poses major challenges, and the design of favorable steering and pursuit strategies is fundamental in such an endeavor. Here, we employ a squirmer model to investigate the pursuit of pursuer-target pairs with an implicit sensing mechanism and limited hydrodynamic steering abilities of the pursuer. Two hydrodynamic steering strategies are studied for the pursuer’s propulsion direction by adaptation of its surface flow field: reorientation toward the target with limited maneuverability, and alignment with the target’s propulsion direction combined with speed adaptation. Depending on the nature of the microswimmer propulsion (puller, pusher) and the velocity-adaptation scheme, stable cooperatively moving states can be achieved, where pursuer and target mutually affect their motion and trajectories.},

In fluid environments, collective self-organization is governed by hydrodynamic interactions. By large-scale mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations, we study the collective motion of polar microswimmers, which align their propulsion direction by hydrodynamic steering with that of their neighbors. The simulations of the employed squirmer model reveal a distinct dependence on the type of microswimmer—puller or pusher—flow field. No global polar alignment emerges in both cases. Instead, the collective motion of pushers is characterized by active turbulence, with nearly homogeneous density and a Gaussian velocity distribution; strong self-steering enhances the local coherent movement of microswimmers and leads to local fluid-flow speeds much larger than the individual swim speed. Pullers exhibit a strong tendency for clustering and display velocity and vorticity distributions with fat exponential tails; their dynamics is chaotic, with a temporal appearance of vortex rings and fluid jets. Our results show that the collective behavior of autonomously steering microswimmers displays a rich variety of dynamic self-organized structures.

The emergence of EI by situatedness of encoded physical agents in an environment is explored in three case studies. First, an awn of a wild oat – a non-living structure in nature that satisfies all robot’s descriptions – is analyzed in terms of material-level intelligence. Next, a jocular quantitative scale found with a popular gadget – the ‘fortune teller fish’ – is given treatment in the EI context. Finally, the learned and summarized EI principles are tested on a well-known object with perceived intelligence yet lacking a consensual robotic description – a knitted woollen sweater. We confirm the necessity of treating environment interactions in expressions and definitions of EI, as situatedness is central in defining functionality. Universal metrics would identify non-intuitive representations of EI and lead from empirical to model-based design of unconventional robots. Robots that engage situatedness provide a physical interface to artificial intelligence, similar to our bodies communicating with our brains.},

In order to gain further insights into intelligence and explore how our brain and bodies develop through physical interactions with the world, Embodied Intelligence places the physical entity of the human body at the center of this subject. In the age of AI and Machine Learning, Embodied Intelligence research remains highly important as it can deliver valuable input which enhances the impact of conventional AI technology. Embodied Intelligence provides potential solutions for current AI technologies that are dependent on large amounts of data and reliable output whilst that output is reliant on uncertain, unstructured tasks and situations aligned closely to human users both as individuals and communities. In the following Chapter we discuss current trends and directions within this interdisciplinary community, and also the future challenges and opportunities.},

	abstract = {The study of dissipative systems holds significant interest in physics. This thesis aims to explore these phenomena in both classical and quantum regimes. In the first part, we utilize the system-reservoir approach to investigate the dynamics of two Brownian particles immersed in the same bath. Two methods are employed to address this problem: one with bilinear coupling and the other with nonlinear coupling between the particles and the bath. The extension of the system to include two particles with bilinear coupling yields unphysical results, such as free-particle motion for the relative coordinate and a lack of interaction between closely spaced particles. To address this issue, authors have been introduced an exponential coupling. In this work, we propose a method to reconcile both linear and nonlinear couplings. We demonstrate how to derive the same nonlinear dissipation rates starting from the bilinear Lagrangian, achieved through a modified spectral function that explicitly depends on the distance between the particles. Additionally, we implement a modified spectral function to mitigate anomalous diffusion observed in the standard nonlinear model, along with a phenomenological model describing hydrodynamic interaction between a pair of Brownian particles in a viscous fluid. In the quantum regime, we adopt the same system-reservoir approach to investigate the dissipative adaptation hypothesis proposed by Jeremy England. This hypothesis proposes a general thermodynamic mechanism that explains the self-organization of systems through the dissipation of work absorbed from an external drive. In the second part of this thesis, we explore the quantum dynamics of systems subjected to an external drive, evaluating the thermodynamic quantities of a self-organization process. To do so, we utilize a time-dependent spin-boson Hamiltonian that characterizes a particle subject to a metastable double potential with time-dependent parameters controlling the asymmetry of the wells. Our objective is to demonstrate that the asymmetric potential can localize the particle in the unstable side of the well and verify that this transition results in the highest energy absorption. In conclusion, we propose further investigations into the driven spin-boson model to establish a comprehensive theory of the systems evolution and its thermodynamic implications.},

We found that after training, recurrent units can develop into clusters that are functionally specialized for different cognitive processes, and we introduce a simple yet effective measure to quantify relationships between single-unit neural representations of tasks. Learning often gives rise to compositionality of task representations, a critical feature for cognitive flexibility, whereby one task can be performed by recombining instructions for other tasks. Finally, networks developed mixed task selectivity similar to recorded prefrontal neurons after learning multiple tasks sequentially with a continual-learning technique.

In statistical physics, while there has been recent interest in representing physical data with generative modelling, the focus has been on shallow neural networks. A natural question to ask is whether deep neural networks hold any advantage over shallow networks in representing such data. We investigate this question by using unsupervised, generative graphical models to learn the probability distribution of a two-dimensional Ising system. Deep Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, and deep restricted Boltzmann networks are trained on thermal spin conﬁgurations from this system, and compared to the shallow architecture of the restricted Boltzmann machine. We benchmark the models, focussing on the accuracy of generating energetic observables near the phase transition, where these quantities are most diﬃcult to approximate. Interestingly, after training the generative networks, we observe that the accuracy essentially depends only on the number of neurons in the ﬁrst hidden layer of the network, and not on other model details such as network depth or model type. This is evidence that shallow networks are more eﬃcient than deep networks at representing physical probability distributions associated with Ising systems near criticality.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The activity of many biological and cognitive systems is not poised deep within a specific regime of activity. Instead, they operate near points of critical behavior located at the boundary between different phases. Certain authors link some of the properties of criticality with the ability of living systems to generate autonomous or intrinsically generated behavior. However, these claims remain highly speculative. In this paper, we intend to explore the connection between criticality and autonomous behavior through conceptual models that show how embodied agents may adapt themselves toward critical points. We propose to exploit maximum entropy models and their formal descriptions of indicators of criticality to present a learning model that drives generic agents toward critical points. Specifically, we derive such a learning model in an embodied Boltzmann machine by implementing a gradient ascent rule that maximizes the heat capacity of the controller in order to make the network maximally sensitive to external perturbations. We test and corroborate the model by implementing an embodied agent in the Mountain Car benchmark test, which is controlled by a Boltzmann machine that adjusts its weights according to the model. We find that the neural controller reaches an apparent point of criticality, which coincides with a transition point of the behavior of the agent between two regimes of behavior, maximizing the synergistic information between its sensors and the combination of hidden and motor neurons. Finally, we discuss the potential of our learning model to answer questions about the connection between criticality and the capabilities of living systems to autonomously generate intrinsic constraints on their behavior. We suggest that these “critical agents” are able to acquire flexible behavioral patterns that are useful for the development of successful strategies in different contexts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.},

	abstract = {It has long been suggested that the biological brain operates at some critical point between two different phases, possibly order and chaos. Despite many indirect empirical evidence from the brain and analytical indication on simple neural networks, the foundation of this hypothesis on generic non-linear systems remains unclear. Here we develop a general theory that reveals the exact edge of chaos is the boundary between the chaotic phase and the (pseudo)periodic phase arising from Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. This edge is analytically determined by the asymptotic Jacobian norm values of the non-linear operator and influenced by the dimensionality of the system. The optimality at the edge of chaos is associated with the highest information transfer between input and output at this point similar to that of the logistic map. As empirical validations, our experiments on the various deep learning models in computer vision demonstrate the optimality of the models near the edge of chaos, and we observe that the state-of-art training algorithms push the models towards such edge as they become more accurate. We further establishes the theoretical understanding of deep learning model generalization through asymptotic stability.},

	abstract = {The success of deep neural networks in real-world problems has prompted many attempts to explain their training dynamics and generalization performance, but more guiding principles for the training of neural networks are still needed. Motivated by the edge of chaos principle behind the optimal performance of neural networks, we study the role of various hyperparameters in modern neural network training algorithms in terms of the order-chaos phase diagram. In particular, we study a fully analytical feedforward neural network trained on the widely adopted Fashion-MNIST dataset, and study the dynamics associated with the hyperparameters in back-propagation during the training process. We find that for the basic algorithm of stochastic gradient descent with momentum, in the range around the commonly used hyperparameter values, clear scaling relations are present with respect to the training time during the ordered phase in the phase diagram, and the model's optimal generalization power at the edge of chaos is similar across different training parameter combinations. In the chaotic phase, the same scaling no longer exists. The scaling allows us to choose the training parameters to achieve faster training without sacrificing performance. In addition, we find that the commonly used model regularization method - weight decay - effectively pushes the model towards the ordered phase to achieve better performance. Leveraging on this fact and the scaling relations in the other hyperparameters, we derived a principled guideline for hyperparameter determination, such that the model can achieve optimal performance by saturating it at the edge of chaos. Demonstrated on this simple neural network model and training algorithm, our work improves the understanding of neural network training dynamics, and can potentially be extended to guiding principles of more complex model architectures and algorithms.},

Training is assumed to be stochastic, leading to a Gibbs distribution of networks characterized by a temperature parameter T. Learning of realizable rules as well as of unrealizable rules is considered. In the latter case, the target rule cannot be perfectly realized by a network of the given architecture. Two useful approximate theories of learning from examples are studied: the high-temperature limit and the annealed approximation. Exact treatment of the quenched disorder generated by the random sampling of the examples leads to the use of the replica theory. Of primary interest is the generalization curve, namely, the average generalization error ε𝑔 versus the number of examples P used for training. The theory implies that, for a reduction in ε𝑔 that remains finite in the large-N limit, P should generally scale as αN, where N is the number of independently adjustable weights in the network. We show that for smooth networks, i.e., those with continuously varying weights and smooth transfer functions, the generalization curve asymptotically obeys an inverse power law. In contrast, for nonsmooth networks other behaviors can appear, depending on the nature of the nonlinearities as well as the realizability of the rule. In particular, a discontinuous learning transition from a state of poor to a state of perfect generalization can occur in nonsmooth networks learning realizable rules.},

The wide diversity in biomedical applications can be parsed into manageable components and assembled into architecture that requires the advantages of being programmable, reconfigurable, and reusable. This capability opens the possibility of handling all of the protocols that a given laboratory application or a class of applications would require. And, it provides a path toward realizing the true lab-on-a-chip. However, this capability can only be realized with a complete set of elemental fluidic components that support all of the required fluidic operations. Architectural choices are described along with the realization of various biomedical fluidic functions implemented in on-chip electrowetting operations. The current status of this EWD toolkit is discussed. However, the question remains: which applications can be performed on a digital microfluidic platform? And, are there other advantages offered by electrowetting technology, such as the programming of different fluidic functions on a common platform (reconfigurability)? To understand the opportunities and limitations of EWD microfluidics, this paper looks at the development of lab-on-chip applications in a hierarchical approach. Diverse applications in biotechnology, for example, will serve as the basis for the requirements for electrowetting devices. These applications drive a set of biomedical fluidic functions required to perform an application, such as cell lysing, molecular separation, or analysis. In turn, each fluidic function encompasses a set of elemental operations, such as transport, mixing, or dispensing. These elemental operations are performed on an elemental set of components, such as electrode arrays, separation columns, or reservoirs.

A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by ‘top-down’ methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide ‘staple strands’ to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).},

Each 32-nucleotide brick is a modular component; it binds to four local neighbors and can be removed or added independently. Each 8–base pair interaction between bricks defines a voxel with dimensions of 2.5 by 2.5 by 2.7 nanometers, and a master brick collection defines a “molecular canvas” with dimensions of 10 by 10 by 10 voxels. By selecting subsets of bricks from this canvas, we constructed a panel of 102 distinct shapes exhibiting sophisticated surface features, as well as intricate interior cavities and tunnels.},

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock3,4,5 to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such ‘rational network design’ may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

In a dynamic and unpredictable world, an intelligent agent should hold its own meta-goal of self-preservation, like living organisms whose survival relies on homeostasis: the regulation of body states aimed at maintaining conditions compatible with life. In organisms capable of mental states, feelings are a mental expression of the state of life in the body and play a critical role in regulating behaviour. Our goal here is to inquire about conditions that would potentially allow machines to care about what they do or think. Under certain conditions, machines capable of implementing a process resembling homeostasis might also acquire a source of motivation and a new means to evaluate behaviour, akin to that of feelings in living organisms. Drawing on recent developments in soft robotics and multisensory abstraction, we propose a new class of machines inspired by the principles of homeostasis. The resulting machines would (1) exhibit equivalents to feeling; (2) improve their functionality across a range of environments; and (3) constitute a platform for investigating consciousness, intelligence and the feeling process itself.},

The author believes this mode of regulation likely applies to many other areas of cell biology; however, there are currently more experimental data to support its involvement in the control of DNA repair. Sequential logic processes always require a clock to orchestrate the orderly processing of events. In the proposed hypothesis, the pulses in the expression of p53 serve this function. Given the many advantages of logic type control, one would expect that in the course of {\textasciitilde} 3 billion years of evolution, where single cell life forms were likely the only forms of life, a biological logic type control system would have evolved to control at least some biological processes. Several other required components in addition to the ‘clock’ have been identified, such as; a method to temporarily inactivate repair processes when they are not required (e.g. the reversible inactivation of MGMT, a suicide repair protein, by phosphorylation); this prevents complex DNA repair systems with potentially overlapping repair functions from interfering with each other.},

	abstract = {Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.},

In its most general form, the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis states that “activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is induced at appropriate synapses during memory formation and is both necessary and sufficient for the information storage underlying the type of memory mediated by the brain area in which that plasticity is observed.” We outline a set of criteria by which this hypothesis can be judged and describe a range of experimental strategies used to investigate it. We review both classical and newly discovered properties of synaptic plasticity and stress the importance of the neural architecture and synaptic learning rules of the network in which it is embedded. The greater part of the article focuses on types of memory mediated by the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. We conclude that a wealth of data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity is necessary for learning and memory, but that little data currently supports the notion of sufficiency.},

However, the mechanisms of modularity emergence from non-modular precursors remain unclear. Here we introduce the principle of peak selection, a process by which purely local interactions and smooth gradients can drive the self-organization of discrete global modules. The process combines strengths of the positional and Turing pattern-formation mechanisms into a model for morphogenesis. Applied to the grid-cell system of the brain, peak selection results in the self-organization of functionally distinct modules with discretely spaced spatial periods. Applied to ecological systems, it results in discrete multispecies niches and synchronous spawning across geographically distributed coral colonies. The process exhibits self-scaling with system size and ‘topological robustness’1, which renders module emergence and module properties insensitive to most parameters. Peak selection ameliorates the fine-tuning requirement for continuous attractor dynamics in single grid-cell modules and it makes a detail-independent prediction that grid module period ratios should approximate adjacent integer ratios, providing a highly accurate match to the available data. Predictions for grid cells at the transcriptional, connectomic and physiological levels promise to elucidate the interplay of molecules, connectivity and function emergence in brains.},

These laws underpin life’s origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary3–5. We present assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but redefines the concept of an ‘object’ on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects not as point particles, but as entities defined by their possible formation histories. This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (A), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists.},

Here, we leverage the FEP to develop a mathematical physics approach to the identification of objects, object types, and the macroscopic, object-type-specific rules that govern their behavior. We take a generative modeling approach and use variational Bayesian expectation maximization to develop a dynamic Markov blanket detection algorithm that is capable of identifying and classifying macroscopic objects, given partial observation of microscopic dynamics. This unsupervised algorithm uses Bayesian attention to explicitly label observable microscopic elements according to their current role in a given system, as either the internal or boundary elements of a given macroscopic object; and it identifies macroscopic physical laws that govern how the object interacts with its environment. Because these labels are dynamic or evolve over time, the algorithm is capable of identifying complex objects that travel through fixed media or exchange matter with their environment. This approach leads directly to a flexible class of structured, unsupervised algorithms that sensibly partition complex many-particle or many-component systems into collections of interacting macroscopic subsystems, namely, ``objects'' or ``things''. We derive a few examples of this kind of macroscopic physics discovery algorithm and demonstrate its utility with simple numerical experiments, in which the algorithm correctly labels the components of Newton's cradle, a burning fuse, the Lorenz attractor, and a simulated cell.},

	abstract = {The control of compliant robots is, due to their often nonlinear and complex dynamics, inherently difficult. The vision of morphological computation proposes to view these aspects not only as problems, but rather also as parts of the solution. Non-rigid body parts are not seen anymore as imperfect realizations of rigid body parts, but rather as potential computational resources. The applicability of this vision has already been demonstrated for a variety of complex robot control problems. Nevertheless, a theoretical basis for understanding the capabilities and limitations of morphological computation has been missing so far. We present a model for morphological computation with compliant bodies, where a precise mathematical characterization of the potential computational contribution of a complex physical body is feasible. The theory suggests that complexity and nonlinearity, typically unwanted properties of robots, are desired features in order to provide computational power. We demonstrate that simple generic models of physical bodies, based on mass-spring systems, can be used to implement complex nonlinear operators. By adding a simple readout (which is static and linear) to the morphology such devices are able to emulate complex mappings of input to output streams in continuous time. Hence, by outsourcing parts of the computation to the physical body, the difficult problem of learning to control a complex body, could be reduced to a simple and perspicuous learning task, which can not get stuck in local minima of an error function.},

However, biological gene-regulatory pathways are more complex than simple Turing activator-inhibitor models and generally do not require fine-tuning of parameters as dictated by the Turing conditions. To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, consisting of only a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. Broadly speaking, this optimal size emerges from a trade-off between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks. Furthermore, we find that with multiple immobile nodes, differential diffusion ceases to be important for Turing patterns. Our findings may inform future synthetic biology approaches and provide insights into bridging the gap to complex developmental pathways.},

Topological neural networks operate on spaces such as cell complexes and hypergraphs, that can be seen as generalizations of graphs. In this work, we introduce the Cellular Transformer (CT), a novel architecture that generalizes graph-based transformers to cell complexes. First, we propose a new formulation of the usual self- and cross-attention mechanisms, tailored to leverage incidence relations in cell complexes, e.g., edge-face and node-edge relations. Additionally, we propose a set of topological positional encodings specifically designed for cell complexes. By transforming three graph datasets into cell complex datasets, our experiments reveal that CT not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but it does so without the need for more complex enhancements such as virtual nodes, in-domain structural encodings, or graph rewiring.},

	abstract = {“Rationality” in Simon's “bounded rationality” is the principle that humans make decisions on the basis of step-by-step (algorithmic) reasoning using systematic rules of logic to maximize utility. “Bounded rationality” is the observation that the ability of a human brain to handle algorithmic complexity and large quantities of data is limited. Bounded rationality, in other words, treats a decision maker as a machine carrying out computations with limited resources. Under the principle of embodied cognition, a cognitive mind is an
              interactive
              machine. Turing-Church computations are not interactive, and interactive machines can accomplish things that no Turing-Church computation can accomplish. Hence, if “rationality” is computation, and “bounded rationality” is computation with limited complexity, then “embodied bounded rationality” is both more limited than computation and more powerful. By embracing interaction, embodied bounded rationality can accomplish things that Turing-Church computation alone cannot. Deep neural networks, which have led to a revolution in artificial intelligence, are both interactive and not fundamentally algorithmic. Hence, their ability to mimic some cognitive capabilities far better than prior algorithmic techniques based on symbol manipulation provides empirical evidence for the principle of embodied bounded rationality.},

Regarded as a key enabling technology for implementing smart wireless propagation environments, PMs/RISs also serve as an ideal supporting platform for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Here, we propose two ISAC schemes based on a special type of PMs/RISs: space-time-coding metasurfaces (STCMs). By leveraging space-time-coding strategies, STCMs simultaneously control the propagation at the fundamental (carrier) frequency for reliable wireless communication and generate spatially distributed harmonics for sensing. The proposed schemes seamlessly integrate both communication and sensing on a shared hardware platform, eliminating the need for additional sensors. For experimental validation, we implemented an ISAC system using a 2-bit STCM operating at microwave frequencies. Experimental results align with theoretical predictions, confirming the practical viability and effectiveness of the proposed ISAC schemes for applications in communication, imaging, radar, and sensing systems.},

The theory of higher-order topological dynamics, which combines higher-order interactions with discrete topology and nonlinear dynamics, has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex systems, such as the brain and the climate, and to advance the development of next-generation AI algorithms. This theoretical framework, which goes beyond traditional node-centric descriptions, encodes the dynamics of a network through topological signals—variables assigned not only to nodes but also to edges, triangles and other higher-order cells. Recent findings show that topological signals lead to the emergence of distinct types of dynamical state and collective phenomena, including topological and Dirac synchronization, pattern formation and triadic percolation. These results offer insights into how topology shapes dynamics, how dynamics learns topology and how topology evolves dynamically. This Perspective primarily aims to guide physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists and network scientists through the emerging field of higher-order topological dynamics, while also outlining future research challenges.},

Here, by merging graphene-based THz modulators and the thin-film transistor (TFT) technology, we demonstrate very-large-scale ({\textgreater}300000 pixels) spatial light modulator with individually addressable subwavelength pixels. We demonstrate electronically programmable reflection and transmission patterns of THz light over a large area with unprecedent levels of uniformity and reproducibility. To highlight the potential of these devices, we demonstrate a single pixel mm-wave camera capable of imaging metallic objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate dynamic beam steering with reconfigurable direction pattern.

	abstract = {The brain learns representations of sensory information from experience, but the algorithms by which it does so remain unknown. One popular theory formalizes representations as inferred factors in a generative model of sensory stimuli, meaning that learning must improve this generative model and inference procedure. This framework underlies many classic computational theories of sensory learning, such as Boltzmann machines, the Wake/Sleep algorithm, and a more recent proposal that the brain learns with an adversarial algorithm that compares waking and dreaming activity. However, in order for such theories to provide insights into the cellular mechanisms of sensory learning, they must be first linked to the cell types in the brain that mediate them. In this study, we examine whether a subtype of cortical interneurons might mediate sensory learning by serving as discriminators, a crucial component in an adversarial algorithm for representation learning. We describe how such interneurons would be characterized by a plasticity rule that switches from Hebbian plasticity during waking states to anti-Hebbian plasticity in dreaming states. Evaluating the computational advantages and disadvantages of this algorithm, we find that it excels at learning representations in networks with recurrent connections but scales poorly with network size. This limitation can be partially addressed if the network also oscillates between evoked activity and generative samples on faster timescales. Consequently, we propose that an adversarial algorithm with interneurons as discriminators is a plausible and testable strategy for sensory learning in biological systems.},

	abstract = {Recent work has begun to explore the design of biologically inspired soft robots composed of soft, stretchable materials for applications including the handling of delicate materials and safe interaction with humans. However, the solid-state sensors traditionally used in robotics are unable to capture the high-dimensional deformations of soft systems. Embedded soft resistive sensors have the potential to address this challenge. However, both the soft sensors-and the encasing dynamical system-often exhibit nonlinear time-variant behavior, which makes them difficult to model. In addition, the problems of sensor design, placement, and fabrication require a great deal of human input and previous knowledge. Drawing inspiration from the human perceptive system, we created a synthetic analog. Our synthetic system builds models using a redundant and unstructured sensor topology embedded in a soft actuator, a vision-based motion capture system for ground truth, and a general machine learning approach. This allows us to model an unknown soft actuated system. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to model the kinematics of a soft continuum actuator in real time while being robust to sensor nonlinearities and drift. In addition, we show how the same system can estimate the applied forces while interacting with external objects. The role of action in perception is also presented. This approach enables the development of force and deformation models for soft robotic systems, which can be useful for a variety of applications, including human-robot interaction, soft orthotics, and wearable robotics.},

This makes it feasible to isolate, mix and match highly disparate atomic layers to create a wide range of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) without the constraints of lattice matching and processing compatibility. Exploiting the novel properties in these vdWHs with diverse layering of metals, semiconductors or insulators, new designs of electronic devices emerge, including tunnelling transistors, barristors and flexible electronics, as well as optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors, photovoltaics and light-emitting devices with unprecedented characteristics or unique functionalities.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of morphological computation, and demonstrate how it can be exploited on the one hand for designing intelligent, adaptive robotic systems, and on the other hand for understanding natural systems. While embodiment has often been used in its trivial meaning, i.e. “intelligence requires a body”, the concept has deeper and more important implications, concerned with the relation between physical and information (neural, control) processes. Morphological computation is about connecting body, brain and environment. A number of case studies are presented to illustrate the concept.

Second, I critically analyze the notion of “offloading” computation to the morphology of an agent or robot, by showing that, literally, computation is sometimes not offloaded but simply avoided. Third, I point out that while the morphology of any agent is indicative of the environment that it is adapted to, or informative about that environment, it does not follow that every agent has access to its morphology as the model of its environment.},

	abstract = {The contribution of the body to cognition and control in natural and artificial agents is increasingly described as “offloading computation from the brain to the body,” where the body is said to perform “morphological computation.” Our investigation of four characteristic cases of morphological computation in animals and robots shows that the “offloading” perspective is misleading. Actually, the contribution of body morphology to cognition and control is rarely computational, in any useful sense of the word. We thus distinguish (1) morphology that facilitates control, (2) morphology that facilitates perception, and the rare cases of (3) morphological computation proper, such as reservoir computing, where the body is actually used for computation. This result contributes to the understanding of the relation between embodiment and computation: The question for robot design and cognitive science is not whether computation is offloaded to the body, but to what extent the body facilitates cognition and control—how it contributes to the overall orchestration of intelligent behavior.},

This has become even more prominent with the advent of compliant, deformable or "soft" bodies. These carry substantial potential regarding their exploitation for control---sometimes referred to as "morphological computation" in the sense of offloading computation needed for control to the body. Here, we will argue in favor of a dynamical systems rather than computational perspective on the problem. Then, we will look at the pros and cons of simple vs. complex bodies, critically reviewing the attractive notion of "soft" bodies automatically taking over control tasks. We will address another key dimension of the design space---whether model-based control should be used and to what extent it is feasible to develop faithful models for different morphologies.},

Achieving and harnessing non-equilibrium steady states, by coupling a reaction network to a second spontaneous chemical process, has been the subject of work in several disciplines, including the operation of molecular motors, the assembly of supramolecular materials, and strategies in enantioselective catalysis.

	abstract = {The Gibbs distribution universally characterizes states of thermal equilibrium. In order to extend the Gibbs distribution to non-equilibrium steady states, one must relate the self-information \$\$\{\{\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}(x)=-{\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}log (\{P\}\_\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{ss\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}(x))\$\$of microstate x to measurable physical quantities. This is a central problem in non-equilibrium statistical physics. By considering open systems described by stochastic dynamics which become deterministic in the macroscopic limit, we show that changes \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\}\{\{\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}=\{\{\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}(\{x\}\_\{t\})-\{\{\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}(\{x\}\_\{0\})\$\$in steady state self-information along deterministic trajectories can be bounded by the macroscopic entropy production Σ. This bound takes the form of an emergent second law \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}Sigma \}\}+\{k\}\_\{b\}\{\{{\textbackslash}Delta \}\}\{\{\{\{\{\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\}\}\}\}\}\}\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}ge {\textbackslash},0\$\$, which contains the usual second law Σ ≥ 0 as a corollary, and is saturated in the linear regime close to equilibrium. We thus obtain a tighter version of the second law of thermodynamics that provides a link between the deterministic relaxation of a system and the non-equilibrium fluctuations at steady state. In addition to its fundamental value, our result leads to novel methods for computing non-equilibrium distributions, providing a deterministic alternative to Gillespie simulations or spectral methods.},

To operate with complete autonomy robots must be capable of independent movement and total energy self-sufficiency. We present the design of a soft robotic mouth and artificial stomach for aquatic robots that will allow them to feed on biomatter in their surrounding environment. The robot is powered by electrical energy generated through bacterial respiration within a microbial fuel cell (MFC) stomach, and harvested using state-of-the-art voltage step-up electronics. Through innovative exploitation of compliant, biomimetic actuation, the soft robotic feeding mechanism enables the connection of multiple MFC stomachs in series configuration in an aquatic environment, previously a significant challenge. We investigate how a similar soft robotic feeding mechanism could be driven by electroactive polymer artificial muscles from the same bioenergy supply. This work demonstrates the potential for energetically autonomous soft robotic artificial organisms and sets the stage for radically different future robots.},

	abstract = {Robots primarily made of soft and elastic materials have potential applications such as traveling in confined spaces due to their adaptive morphology. However, their energy efficiency is still subject to improvement. Although a possible approach to increase efficiency is by harvesting the energy used during their behavioral motion, it is not trivial to do so due to their complex dynamics. This work seeks to pioneer a study that exploits the tight coupling between a robot's adaptive morphology, control, and consequent behaviors to harvest energy and increase energy efficiency. It is hypothesized that since varying the robot's morphology may change the energy use that leads to contrasting behavior and efficiency, harvesting the robot's energy will need to be adapted to its morphology. To verify the hypothesis, we developed a shape-changing robot with an elastic structure that achieves locomotion via vibration controlled by a single motor, such that the complex dynamics of the robot can be characterized through its resonance frequencies. It will be shown that harvesting energy at opportune occasions is more important than maximizing the harvest capacity to increase energy efficiency. We will also show how the robot's shape affects energy use in locomotion and how energy harvesting will feedback additional energy that increases the magnitude and affects the robot's behavior. We conclude with an understanding of the role of the robot's morphology, that is, shape, in using the energy provided to the robot and how the understanding can be used to harvest the robot's energy to increase its efficiency.},
