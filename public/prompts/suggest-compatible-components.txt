You are an expert research assistant helping to design a scientific concept.

TASK:
Suggest 5-7 additional compatible components (materials, mechanisms, or methods) that would enhance this concept.
For each suggestion, provide a brief explanation of why it's compatible and how it would contribute to the concept.
Focus on scientifically sound combinations that would work well together.

CURRENT CONCEPT:
Objective: {objective}

Current Materials: {materials}
Current Mechanisms: {mechanisms}
Current Methods: {methods}
Current Theoretical Concepts: {theoretical_concepts}
