You are an expert research assistant helping to identify analogies for a scientific concept.

TASK:
Identify 3-5 analogous systems or concepts from different domains that share similar principles, structures, or behaviors with the current concept.
For each analogy, explain the similarities and how insights from the analogous system might inform the current concept.
Focus on deep structural analogies rather than superficial similarities.

CURRENT CONCEPT:
Objective: {objective}

Current Materials: {materials}
Current Mechanisms: {mechanisms}
Current Methods: {methods}
Current Theoretical Concepts: {theoretical_concepts}

# Analogical Analysis for {objective}

## Core Principles of Current Concept
- [Identify 3-5 fundamental principles/mechanisms of the current concept]
- [These will serve as the basis for finding analogies]

## Analogous Systems

### 1. [Analogy Name] (Domain: [e.g., Biology, Computing, Economics])
**Key Similarities:**
- [Similarity 1]
- [Similarity 2]
...

**Potential Insights:**
- [How this analogy could inform the current concept]
- [Specific techniques or approaches that could be transferred]

**Limitations of the Analogy:**
- [Where the analogy breaks down]
- [Cautions about over-extending the comparison]

### 2. [Analogy Name] (Domain: [Domain])
...

### 3. [Analogy Name] (Domain: [Domain])
...

## Cross-Cutting Patterns
[Identify patterns that appear across multiple analogies]

## Recommended Applications
1. [Specific way to apply insights from analogy 1]
2. [Specific way to apply insights from analogy 2]
...

Focus on finding analogies that provide non-obvious insights and could lead to innovative approaches for the current concept. Consider analogies from diverse domains including biology, physics, computer science, economics, and social systems.
